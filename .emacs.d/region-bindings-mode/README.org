* Introduction

  Minor mode that enables the ability of having a custom keys for
  working with regions.  This is a pretty good way to keep the global
  bindings clean.

* Requirements

  This package was tested with GNU/Emacs 24 only, it should work with
  others versions too but I can't ensure anything. Besides from that
  nothing else is required.

* Installation/Usage

  Add this to your .emacs:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/folder/containing/file")
  (require 'region-bindings-mode)
  (region-bindings-mode-enable)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Then add some nice bindings that will be enabled only when you
  happen to be working on a region, Here's an example setup
  integrating the excellent [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple-cursors]] package:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (define-key region-bindings-mode-map "a" 'mc/mark-all-like-this)
  (define-key region-bindings-mode-map "p" 'mc/mark-previous-like-this)
  (define-key region-bindings-mode-map "n" 'mc/mark-next-like-this)
  (define-key region-bindings-mode-map "m" 'mc/mark-more-like-this-extended)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  In this use case, you would probably want these bindings to work
  within specific scenarios.  For example, =multiple-cursors= doesn't
  make much sense in read-only buffers.  You could prevent
  =region-bindings-mode= in these by setting
  =region-bindings-mode-disable-predicates= to:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ((lambda () buffer-read-only))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  You can also exclude specific modes via =region-bindings-mode-disabled-modes=,
  or specify a white-list of allowed modes via =region-bindings-mode-enabled-modes=.
