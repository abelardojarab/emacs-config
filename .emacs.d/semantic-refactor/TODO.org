* DONE Check whether a dot character is a cons or a number
CLOSED: [2015-12-03 Thu 18:44]
Actually we don't need to check because when dot is a inside a number, Semantic
can recognize it. When it's a cons operator, Semantic treats such dot character
a symbol.
* TODO [#A] Handle character syntax in Emacs, otherwise it becomes a mess
  Samples:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (modify-syntax-entry ?\>"" st)          ; character not insert spacen next to string
  (modify-syntax-entry ? \> (if vhdl-underscore-is-part-of-word "w" "_")
                           st)            ; erroneous space between ? and \>
#+end_src
* TODO [#B] Allow uers to add customizability and extensibility for arbitrary form
* TODO [#A] Fix getter/setter generation of a list of variables
Currently, Semantic can't regonize a list of variables with the same type
properly. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
int x, y;
#+END_SRC

=semantic-current-tag= only returns tag =y=.

I need to write a function to break such list into proper variable tags.
