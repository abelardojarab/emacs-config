Changes/New Features in 5.14:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[BUGS/JAGS]}:  Batch BUGS is back!  For recent OpenBUGS
versions, 3.0.8+, a batch BUGS script is once again available,
but for Linux only.  Therefore, since it seems that BUGS and JAGS must
co-exist (rather than a transition from BUGS to JAGS), .bug files are
now in @ESS{[BUGS]} mode and .jag files are in @ESS{[JAGS]} mode.  @ESS{[BUGS]} now
works like @ESS{[JAGS]} rather than the original mode @ESS{[BUGS]} mode which
was difficult to maintain.  Although, @ESS{[BUGS]} appears to work,
there still may be some features missing as well as bugs.

@item @ESS{[R]}: New customizable variable @code{ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX-p}
Commands to Sweave current file and LaTeX the result are now available
to AUCTeX users, if this variable is set to @code{t}.

@item @ESS{[S]}: @kbd{C-c C-c}
(@code{ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step}) is now skipping over
comments as the other paragraph functions do.
It (and similar functions) should no longer wrongly find
@samp{function()} beginnings inside comments or strings.

@item @ESS{[SAS]}: improved by better support for GNU Emacs
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.13:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: On Windows, for R 2.12.0 and later, the Rterm executables
 (in subdirectories i386 / x64) now are found as well as for earlier R versions.
@item @ESS{[S+]}: on Windows, both 32- and 64-bit versions of S+ (``S-PLUS'')
 are found now and made available on the menu.
@item @ESS{[R]}: When prompting for a starting directory, the R version is
 (always?) correct now.
@item @ESS{[R]}: on non-Windows platforms, the @code{use-dialog-box}
 variable is no longer temporarily changed (to @code{nil} for R-x.y.z version
 functions and to @code{t} for @command{R} itself), but rather the user
 customization is obeyed.
@item @ESS{[R]}: more Roxygen improvements.
@item `Rd-preview-help' now generates preview buffers with navigation
facilities the same as regular help buffers.
@item @ESS{}: New functions and keys C-c [up] / [down]
 for evaluating the buffer ``from beginning till here''.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.12:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[SAS]} Font-locking:
 update of PROCs keywords (up to SAS 9.22); error/warnings.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Roxygen improvements: S4 classes;
 also optionally keep spaces when filling arguments
@item @ESS{[Rd]}: support new keywords:
 section-name \subsection plus a dozen ``new'' keywords; should match R
 2.12.x now.
@item @command{ess-display-help-on-object} (@kbd{C-c C-v})
 now @emph{caches} the list of topics, thus speeding up the improvement
 feature introduced in 5.9.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.11:
@itemize @bullet
@item Filename completion within buffers now adds only trailing
characters to complete the filename, rather than expanding to an
absolute file path.  This filename completion is bound to the TAB key.

@item @kbd{M-n P} in Sweave buffers now prompts for the command to run
instead of using @command{pdflatex} unconditionally, offering completion from
customizable collection @code{ess-swv-pdflatex-commands}, the first of
which is taken as default and that defaults to @command{texi2pdf}.
@item @kbd{M-RET} is now also bound in S language (R and S+) buffers
to @command{ess-use-this-dir}. It sends @code{setwd(..)} to the S process
to set the working directory to the one of the source file.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.10:
@itemize @bullet
@item @kbd{M-RET} in *S* buffers is now bound to
@code{ess-dirs}.  This function will set Emacs's current
directory to be the same as the *S* process.  This is useful if you use
@code{setwd()} within a *S* process.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.9:
@itemize @bullet
@item Toolbar:  The toolbar now has an icon for starting Splus.
@item Indentation: New documentation and code has been added to make it
easier to change how ESS indents code.  In particular, see
@code{ess-default-style}, @code{ess-own-style-list} and the documention
subsection ``Changing indentation styles''.
@item @command{ess-display-help-on-object} (@kbd{C-c C-v}) now offers
 completion candidates for help file aliases, in addition to object
 names.
@item Font locking: is now turned on
 even without @command{window-system} is @code{nil}, whenever
 @var{ess-font-lock-mode} is non-nil, i.e., by default.
@item @ESS{} script editing: ess-eval-deactivate-mark default is now t,
 as suggested by Leo Alekseyev and subsequent ``unanimous'' ESS-help
 discussion.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Editing support for ``#!'' (Rscript / littler) editing,
 thanks to Jeffrey Arnold.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Now finds all R versions, both 64-bit and 32-bit, on some
 64-bit Windows machines.  Please report back to ess-core success or failure
 on your 64-bit Windows machine.
@item ESS Manual now more visually pleasing; @uref{http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html}
@item @ESS{[R]}: Roxygen on XEmacs no longer font locks for now
 (as it required missing features and hence broke ESS startup, there).
@item @ESS{[R]}: Roxygen has a sub-menu on the [ESS] menu.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Function @command{ess-rutils-htmldocs} in
 @file{ess-rutils.el} offers an alternative to @code{help.start()} for
 navigating R documentation, using the @command{browse-url} Emacs
 function.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.8:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: New @file{ess-rutils.el} with utilities for listing, loading,
installing, and updating packages, as well as object manipulation
(listing, viewing, and deleting).  It also provides an alternative to
@code{RSiteSearch()} that uses the @command{browse-url} function, so
results can be viewed in an Emacs web browser.
@item @ESS{[R]}: much more extensive Roxygen interface, via ess-roxy.el
 from Henning Redestig. Ess-roxy supports filling of roxygen fields,
 generation and updating roxygen templates, completion of roxygen tags,
 basic navigation (marking and moving between entries), folding using
 hs-minor-mode and preview of the Rd file.
@item Emacs lisp files have got better names (partly, for now).
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.7:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: loading a source file (@kbd{C-c C-l}) now works in
 Windows, similarly to other platforms;
 (further; it had accidentally been broken in ESS 5.6 on all platforms)
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.6:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: help() calls have to differ from old default, with newer
 versions of R; currently via .help.ESS <- function(...) hack.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.4:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: The long overdue change
from @code{make-regexp} to @code{regexp-opt} for font-locking is
complete.  The new @code{regexp-opt} is now the default since
it is better than the old code in many ways (and especially more
maintainable).  However, there are certainly some special
cases missed (bug reports and patches welcome!).
Setting @code{ess-sas-run-regexp-opt} to @code{nil} will result
in the old code being used.
@item @ESS{[BUGS]} and @ESS{[JAGS]}: typing @code{=} now results in
 @code{<-}.
@item @ESS{[R]} function arguments ``show'' @code{(ess-r-args-show)} now
 uses the new @code{(tooltip-show-at-point)} contributed by Erik Iverson.
@item Toolbar icons now also work in (beta) Emacs 23.
@item @ESS{[S]}: New function @code{ess-change-directory} for setting both
 emacs' current directory and the directory of an *R* or *S* buffer.
@item @ESS{[S]} when transient-mark-mode is true, the mark is now kept,
 rather than deactivated, thanks to a patch from David Reitter.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.11:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: work around bug in Emacs 22.2 & 22.3 which fails to
 set case-fold fontification automatically.
@item Rd mode: support new keyword 'Rdversion'
@item @ESS{[R]}: now again works with Emacs 21.x
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.10:
@itemize @bullet
@item Fixed noweb-mode bug accidentally introduced into 5.3.9
@item In noweb-mode, e.g., Rnw-mode, electric ``<'' also inserts closing ``@@".
 Further, the code chunk boundaries are better kept up-to-date, such that
 code[R] <-> text[LaTeX] minor mode switching should happen more reliably.
@item In noweb-mode, fix a buglet in rare [Enter] or [Tab] behavior; further,
 by default disable the former `[[' .. `]]'  code-protection-when-filling
 behavior which has been found to be buggy.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.9:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: evince PDF viewer now supported as well; search order:
evince, Xpdf, Adobe/Acrobat Reader
@item @ESS{[R]}: added support for Roxygen, potentially to be extended.
@item @ESS{[S]} (and R): inferior (@code{*R*}) and transcript modes no longer
fontify language keywords (such as @code{for}, @code{in}, etc).
@item @iESS{[Stata]}: Customize the @code{ess-sta-delimiter-friendly} setting
to @code{t} to convert embedded semi-colons to newlines for Stata processing.
@item Sweave fix for embedded blanks in PDF reader and PDF files
@item Several fixes for Major Mode Convention violations in @code{ess-mode}
and @code{noweb-mode}.
@item @ESS{[JAGS]}: @code{M-x comment-region} now available!
@item @ESS{[S]} The @code{ess-swv-*} commands (and keybindings) are now in
a submenu of the ``Noweb'' menu, when editing Sweave files.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.8:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[JAGS]}: more separation from @ESS{[BUGS]} (as much as is currently planned);
now @kbd{C-c C-c} on an empty @file{.jmd} creates a template as it should;
symbolic links are created for CODA output so BOA is happy:
from @file{index.txt} to @file{.ind} and @file{chain#.txt} to @file{#.out}
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: buffer-local @code{ess-sas-submit-command} and
@code{ess-sas-submit-command-options} now recognized by @code{ess-sas-submit-region}
@item @ESS{[S]}: When trying to evaluate code in an S language buffer and
 there is no associated process, now start R automatically instead of
 signalling an error.  Also, restart R if there is an associated process
 which is not running.  However, do not start R just via the ``electric''
 @kbd{(} (@code{ess-r-args-auto-show}).
@item @ESS{[S]}: For (one-line) functions withOUT '@{ .. @}' bodys, the end
 of function is now correctly found more often.  This notably improves
 @kbd{C-c C-c} (@code{ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step}).
@item @ESS{[JAGS]}: cleanup/re-organization of elisp code;
symbolic links for CODA output are now only created by the new
JAGS @code{system} command in version 1.0.3; specify whether
this command is available via @code{ess-jags-system}; if not
present, then no links are created so that the @code{*shell*}
buffer does not become unresponsive during the batch run
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.7:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{}: @code{ess-default-style} now *is* customizable, i.e.,
  changing its value in @file{~/.emacs} now does have the desired effect.
@item @ESS{}: @code{ess-font-lock-mode} is a new variable (default: t)
which controls whether font-locking is enabled in ESS buffers.
@item @ESS{[R]}: for XEmacs on Windows; another tweak to find R versions
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: font-locking updated for ODS and SAS Bayesian Procedures;
a more consistent handling of SAS options by
@code{ess-sas-submit-command-options} which is buffer-local; portable
snooze for MS Windows via customize-able @code{ess-sleep-for} (floats welcome);
Xpdf now supported as a PDF viewer
@item @ESS{[Rnw]}: now also works with ``emacs -nw'' and Emacs 22.
@item @ESS{[JAGS]}: now requires JAGS 1.0 (see the new ESS for JAGS help
section for more information): both need work; suggestions welcome
@item @ESS{[R]}: [TAB] completion now uses the R-internal completion
mechanism (for R >= 2.5.0).
@item @ESS{[R], [S]}: interpretation of ``_'' as assignment has
been removed in @code{ess-continued-statement-p} for R and S.
@item several internal code cleanups.
@item @ESS{[R]}: An experimental version of a new command @code{Rgui}
on MS Windows to send lines directly from emacs
to @code{Rgui} is available in file @code{lisp/essd-rgui.el}.
Preliminary documentation is in file @code{doc/rgui-doc.txt}.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.6:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{}: for XEmacs, using ``gnuclient'' (without a ``-q'') works for
 things like fix() after M-x gnuserv-start has been done.
@item @ESS{[R]}: M-x R-newest should now work in more situations on MS
 Windows, e.g., when R has been installed in a non-default "ProgramFiles"
 directory tree.  In these cases, there's no need to specify the name (and
 full path) of the R program anymore.
@item @ESS{[R]}: For XEmacs, startup (with new tooltip code) works again.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.5:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]} a new defun is available, @kbd{M-x R-newest}, which will start
the newest version of R that it can find on your system.
@item @ESS{[R]} add Sven Hartenstein's ``R function arguments tips''
 functionality, via new file @file{../lisp/essd-r-args.el}.
 Note that this includes an ``electric "("'' behavior inside @code{R-mode}
 which is @emph{active by default} and can be customized via
 @code{ess-r-args-electric-paren}; i.e., use @code{(setq
 ess-r-args-electric-paren nil)} to turn it off.  Further,
 @code{ess-r-args-show-as} allows to switch to the ``tooltip'' mode.
@item @ESS{}: functions @code{ess-get-pdf-viewer} and *-ps-viewer; built on new
 customizable variables @code{ess-pdf-viewer-pref} and
 @code{ess-ps-viewer-pref}; currently used in @code{ess-swv-PDF} and
 @code{*-PS}.
@item @ESS{[R]} Improved @code{ess-swv-PDF} to run pdf viewer only if
 pdflatex was ok
@item @ESS{[R]} Improved @code{ess-swv-weave} to start R automatically if
 none is running.
@item @ESS{}: Do no longer ask @emph{which} ESS process to use if there
 is only one.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.4:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]} now better work with options(error=recover); and the
new default of CHM help files on windows.
@item @ESS{[R]} some more cleanup in the ``sweave'' functions
@item miscellaneous fixes
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.3:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[S]} fix buglet (5.3.2 only) which left command prompt in
``execute buffer'' and hence help files.
@item new customizable variable @code{ess-display-buffer-reuse-frames}
set to true (which changes default behavior) such that execution or
help *frames* are reused.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.2:
@itemize @bullet
@item Classic BUGS now supported by @code{(require 'essd-bugs)} with @ESS{[BUGS]}
      and JAGS by @code{(require 'essd-jags)} with @ESS{[JAGS]}.  But, only one
      of them can be used at a time since they don't play nice together.  Also,
      @kbd{C-c C-c} is now bound to the function @code{ess-bugs-next-action}
      (@kbd{F12} has been retired).  And finally, note that @file{essl-bug.el}
      is deprecated and the replacement is @file{essl-bugs.el}.
@item @ESS{[R]} Improved some of the ``Sweave-make''
 functions (yet scarcely documented) in @file{ess-swv.el}.
@item @ESS{[S]} No longer mess with .Last.value (nor in other ``languages'').
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.1:
@itemize @bullet
@item See the docs for 2 ways to install @ESS{} for XEmacs
      @enumerate
      @item by uncommenting the XEmacs part of
            Section 1 of @file{Makeconf} and performing @code{make install}
      @item by unpacking either
            @file{ess-5.3.1.tgz} or @file{ess-5.3.1.zip} into
            @file{PREFIX/lib/xemacs/site-packages} on unix or
            @file{PREFIX\XEmacs\site-packages} on windows
      @end enumerate
@item @ESS{[R]}: fixed bugs so that Rterm.exe can be found by XEmacs
@item @ESS{[S]}: @kbd{ess-toggle-S-assign-key} is slightly changed; in
 particular, the default @code{ess-assign-key} is now @kbd{C-x =}.
@item @ESS{[R]}: @kbd{M-x R-site-search} is a new (slightly experimental)
 utility similar to R's @code{RSiteSearch(..)} but with the advantage of
 using Emacs' preferred browser, see @code{browse-url-browser-function}
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.0:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[BUGS]}: sanely re-format statistical output, @file{.bog},
from scientific notation to numbers rounded with 4 decimal places
with @kbd{M-x ess-bugs-sci-round-to-4-dp}.
@item The keys for navigating among section headings in help buffers
worked, but only for one language per session; they should now work for
multiple languages.  (They were also broken on Windows machines.)
@item @ESS{[S]} long standing buglets in the internal logic for loading
lisp code on Windows.  Particularly fixed behavior in help mode with S-plus
GUI.
@item New variable, @code{ess-use-inferior-program-name-in-buffer-name},
which enables using the executable name instead of the dialect name for
R. Feature request.
@item @ESS{[S]} @kbd{ess-execute-screen-options}
now also works correctly when there is more than one window *side-by-side*
in the same frame and runs in the correct buffer also when there is more
than one S buffer.
@item @iESS{[S]} new functions @code{ess-eval-paragraph-and-step} and
 @code{ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step} are bound to keys
 @kbd{C-c C-p} and @kbd{C-c C-c} respectively and to the menu in
 @ESS{}-mode; also bound in the help mode (for evaluating examples).
@item @ESS{[S]} new function @code{ess-toggle-S-assign-key} allows to
assign the `` <- '' insertion to an arbitrary key.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.12:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: @kbd{M-;} fixed, but the XEmacs function @code{comment-dwim}
may be broken, if so, use @kbd{M-x comment-region} and @kbd{M-x
uncomment-region} instead; only valid PROCs are fontified which is very
helpful finding syntax errors (currently supported: BASE, ETS, FSP, GRAPH,
IML, INSIGHT and STAT); the ``feature'' where @kbd{F}-keys take you to an
empty buffer when the requested destination is a file that does not exist
has been fixed, now the request results in a no-op.
Further, sas-mode now also works in simple terminals.
@item Rterm/Cygwin combination works under Microsoft Windows.
@item @ESS{[R]}: internal calls use baseenv() instead of NULL and
define 'baseenv' where needed.
@item New experimental support for installing ESS.  See the file
@file{lisp/ess-install.el}.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.11:
@itemize @bullet
@item ESS Info entry and @file{dir} handled more effectively for GNU Emacs users
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: temporary files created for batch submission of a
region are now named based on the current file; see @code{ess-sas-file-root}
for details; all @code{lag} and @code{dif} functions now fontified correctly
@item iESS[SAS]: fixed a few nagging bugs, however, still does not appear to
work at this time; please let us know if you have any ideas.
@item @ESS{[S]}: Support for running other versions of Splus has been
added for unix.  Two new variables, @code{ess-s-versions} and
@code{ess-s-versions-list}, are used to tell ESS what other versions of
Splus you would like to run.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.10:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: ess-r-versions can no longer be customized (since the
customization was not taking effect unless customizations were loaded
before ESS).  Its value has been changed so that it will also find R
executables beginning ``R-devel'' and ``R-patched''.  If you wish to
change this variable, it must be set in your @file{.emacs} before ESS is
loaded.
@item Installation with GNU Make enhanced:  unix and unix-like
operating systems will now be able to install @ESS{} for all
users in either a GNU Emacs site-lisp or an XEmacs package
configuration by editing @file{lisp/ess-site.el} and @file{Makeconf}
accordingly, then issuing @code{make install}
@item @ESS{[S]}: Filename completion (inside strings) now also works in
XEmacs for R and S-plus.
@c working around a bug in XEmacs
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.9:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]} for Windows:  the \ directory character bug
with respect to ess-load-file has been eradicated.
@item @iESS{[SAS]}: @kbd{C-c C-r} and @kbd{C-c C-b} once again
work as intended and documented.
@item @ESS{[S]}: M-x ess-fix-EQ-assign is a bit more agressive.
@item @ESS{[S]}: Imenu now also shows setAs(), etc.
@item @ESS{[R]}: R function pattern enhanced with underlying code such that
 @kbd{M-C-a} (@code{ess-beginning-of-function}) etc now work for many more
 cases, including S4 method definitions.
@item @iESS{[R]}: myOwnhelp(1) no longer wrongly triggers help(1).
@item @ESS{[R]}: Improved detection of bogus help buffers: valid help
 buffers containing with the string ``no documentation''(e.g. contour)
 were being treated as bogus.
@item @ESS{[R]}: In R help buffers, if @code{options("help.try.all.packages" =
 TRUE)} then @code{?rlm} will list which packages rlm is defined in.  This help
 buffer is not bogus, but instead is now relabelled ``*help[R](rlm in
 packages)*''.
@item @ESS{[STA]}: add ``//'' as comment starting character to syntax-table.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.8:
@itemize @bullet
@item iESS: [Tab] completes @strong{file} names ``inside string'' as in
earlier (<= 5.2.3) ESS versions.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.7:
@itemize @bullet
@item If you use Custom to change the variable ess-toolbar-items,
the new toolbar is used in all subsequent ESS buffers.
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: new feature:  if ess-sas-log-max >0 and
your .log grows to more than ess-sas-log-max bytes, just
the first ess-sas-log-max bytes are refreshed; this is helpful when your .sas program
generates lots of error messages and gets too big for emacs to display
@item @ESS{[R/S]}: @kbd{M-;} in R/S editing modes will now indent with
either one or two hashes depending on context.
@item @ESS{[R]}: David Whiting's Sweave extensions (to 'noweb')
are now available (from ess-swv.el loaded by default).
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.6:
@itemize @bullet
@item Removed non-ASCII characters in a few files.
@item @ESS{[R]}: now works better when UTF-8 locale is active; in
 particular, you get correct directional quotes in R's startup message
 for R-devel (unstable development version of R 2.1.0) when using
 environment variables LANGUAGE=en@@quot LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: toggling of .log mode improved (@kbd{F10}); toggling of
.lst mode now also available (@kbd{C-F10}); killing all buffers associated
with .sas program no longer bound to @kbd{C-F10} since its a bit overzealous.
@item S-Plus 7 for Windows is now recognized.
@item @ESS{[S]} (incl.@: R): in auto-fill mode, strings are not wrapped anymore.
@item @ESS{[S]} (incl.@: R): font-lock now correctly differs between R and S,
e.g., for "_"; both now fontify warning(.) and S does terminate() additionally.
@item Support for `bell' aka `beep' aka `ding' aka `alarm' in all inferior
modes: When \a is output ``to the the console'' at the beginning of a line,
the bell is rung.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.5:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: @kbd{C-c C-q} or @samp{Quit S} from the menu now should work
(again and less klunkily) and do not append @samp{-exited} to the
buffer name.  Further, the behavior of @code{(ess-cleanup)}, called from
ess-quit, now depends on the new customizable variable
@code{ess-S-quit-kill-buffers-p} which defaults to @code{nil}.
Consequently, the question @emph{``Delete all buffers associated
with ..?''} will not be asked anymore by default.
@item @ESS{[SAS]} -- ess-ebcdic-to-ascii-search-and-replace will now work
with the @code{recode} application as well which is available on many platforms
@item @ESS{[S]} (incl.@: R): Name completion for slots of S4 objects now works!
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.4:
@itemize @bullet
@item The documentation now includes an overview of how to use the emacs
TAGS facility for S functions.  (The distribution also used to contain a
directory @file{etc/other/Tags} where a ~1990 version of @file{etags.c} was
distributed; this is no longer relevant and so has been deleted.)
@item @ESS{[SAS]} -- When you are working with EBCDIC files on an ASCII
platform, .log NOTEs may display as gibberish since the EBCDIC
characters are not converted to ASCII prior to their display.  So,
the function ess-ebcdic-to-ascii-search-and-replace is provided for
convenience and is bound to @kbd{C-F11}.  This function requires the
@code{dd} command (only available on unix or unix-like platforms).
@item ESS: Completion of object names is now always done dynamically rather
than allowing the option of using a pre-computed database (by
@code{ess-create-object-name-db}) since modern computers seem fast
enough for dynamic completion.  (We expect few users, if any, have
been using the pre-computed database method.)
@item ESS: object completion in iESS buffers running on Windows was
very slow (for GNU Emacs, but not XEmacs) and has now been fixed.
Further, it was more or less broken for all versions of S-plus 6.x,
and has been fixed to work everywhere but with the Windows' GUI of
S-plus.  The list of objects now shows unique names also when an
object appears more than once in the search path.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Completion of object names now also includes those
starting with ``.''.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.3:
@itemize @bullet
@item ESS: When new inferior ESS processes are created, by default they
will replace the current buffer (this restores behavior from pre
5.2.0). If you wish new ESS processes to start in another window of the
current frame, set inferior-ess-same-window to nil.
@item New variables inferior-Splus-args and inferior-R-args provide a
way to pass command line arguments to starting S and R processes.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.2:
@itemize @bullet
@item bug-fixes for 5.2.1 (require 'executable), html docs, etc.
@item ess-lisp-directory/../doc/info added to Info-directory-list
if ess-info not found by info
@item @ESS{[R]}: If you have other versions of R on your
exec-path, such as "R-1.8.1" with Unix or "rw1081" with Windows,
ESS will find them and create appropriate functions, such as
@kbd{M-x R-1.8.1} or @kbd{M-x rw1081}, for calling them.
By default only Unix programs beginning "R-1" and
"R-2" and Windows programs parallel to the
version of R in your exec-path will be found,
but see ess-r-versions and ess-rterm-versions for ways to find other
versions of R.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Other versions of R, such as "R-1.8.1" on Unix and "rw1081" on
Windows, are added to the
"ESS / Start Process / Other" menu.
@item @ESS{[S]}: If you have other versions of S-Plus on your Windows computer,
such as S-Plus 6.1 or S-Plus 4.5, ESS will find them and create appropriate
functions, such as @kbd{M-x splus61}, for calling the console version (Sqpe)
inside an emacs buffer.  By default only
programs installed in the default location will be found, but see
ess-SHOME-versions for ways to find other versions of S-Plus.
@item @ESS{[S]}: Other versions of Sqpe on Windows, such as "splus61",
are added to the
"ESS / Start Process / Other" menu.
@item @ESS{[R]}: (bug fix) ess-quit (bound to @kbd{C-c C-q}) should now quit the
inferior R process, when issued from either the inferior buffer, or from
a .R buffer.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.1:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[S]} (R and S-plus): now have toolbar support
with icons to evaluate code in the inferior process or to switch
there.  This code is experimental and likely to change as XEmacs/Emacs
issues get resolved. The toolbar should be enabled if your Emacs
displays images, but can be disabled with the variable ess-use-toolbar.
Thanks to David Smith from Insightful for the S-plus logo.
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: ess-sas-graph-view (@kbd{F12}) enhanced; you can specify
external file viewers for each graphics file type via the alist
ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist; also .jpg/.gif are now handled
by image-mode on XEmacs, if available, otherwise by graphics
primitives as before
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.2.0:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[BUGS]}:  new info documentation!  now supports interactive
processing thanks to @uref{mailto:Aki.Vehtari@@hut.fi, Aki Vehtari};
new architecture-independent unix support as well as support for BUGS v. 0.5
@item @ESS{[SAS]}:  convert .log to .sas with ess-sas-transcript;
info documentation improved; Local Variable bug fixes;
SAS/IML statements/functions now highlighted; files edited
remotely by ange-ftp/EFS/tramp are recognized and pressing
SUBMIT opens a buffer on the remote host via the local variable
ess-sas-shell-buffer-remote-init which defaults to "ssh";
changed the definition of the variable ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle
to boolean rather than 0/1; added the function ess-electric-run-semicolon
which automatically reverse indents lines containing only "run;";
@kbd{C-F1} creates MS RTF portrait from the current buffer;
@kbd{C-F2} creates MS RTF landscape from the current buffer;
@kbd{C-F9} opens a SAS DATASET with PROC INSIGHT rather than PROC FSVIEW;
"inferior" aliases for SAS batch:  @kbd{C-c C-r} for submit region,
@kbd{C-c C-b} for submit buffer, @kbd{C-c C-x} for goto .log; @kbd{C-c C-y} for goto .lst
@item @ESS{[S]}: Pressing underscore ("_") once inserts " <- " (as before);
pressing underscore twice inserts a literal underscore.  To stop this
smart behaviour, add "(ess-toggle-underscore nil)" to your .emacs after
ess-site has been loaded;
ess-dump-filename-template-proto (new name!) now can be
customized successfully (for S language dialects);
Support for Imenu has been improved; set ess-imenu-use-S to non-nil to
get an "Imenu-S" item on your menubar;
ess-help: Now using nice underlines (instead of `nuke-* ^H_')
@item @ESS{[R]}:  After (require 'essa-r), @kbd{M-x ess-r-var} allows to load
numbers from any Emacs buffer into an existing *R* process;
@kbd{M-x ess-rdired} gives a ``directory editor'' of R objects;
fixed ess-retr-lastvalue-command, i.e. .Last.value bug
(thanks to David Brahm)
@item ESS: Support for creating new window frames has been added to
ESS.  Inferior ESS processes can be created in dedicated frames by
setting inferior-ess-own-frame to t.  ESS help buffers can also open in
new frames; see the documentation for ess-help-own-frame for details.
(Thanks to Kevin Rodgers for contributing code.)

@item Minor more Makefile clean up.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.1.22:
@itemize @bullet
@item Besides info documentation, PDF and HTML
documentation are also provided (instead of built using "make") and available
on the web as well; see @uref{http://ess.r-project.org/,
 ESS web page} and @uref{http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/doc, StatLib}
@item Now that info documentation is available, the
README.* files are no longer supported.  However, they
are still distributed for what it's worth.
@item ESS is now an XEmacs package!  See
@uref{http://www.xemacs.org/Install/index.html, XEmacs Installation HOWTO}
for details (specifically, items 10-15).
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: more user-friendly enhancements for remote
SAS batch jobs with Kermit file transfers (LOG and OUTPUT
function key features now supported).  Multiple shells
now supported so you can run SAS on different computers
from different buffers by setting the buffer-local variable
ess-sas-shell-buffer to unique buffer names.
@item Major re-vamping of Makefile/Makeconf.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.1.21:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: info documentation now available!, see
ESS->Help for SAS; @kbd{F12} opens GSASFILE nearest point for viewing
either within emacs, when available, or via an external viewer;
more syntax highlighting keywords; more enhancements for remote
SAS batch jobs with Kermit; new framework for remote SAS interactive
jobs, see ess-remote
@item @ESS{[S]}: info documentation now available!, see
ESS->Help for the S family
@item Makefile: tag now independent of rel; info files

@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.1.20:
@itemize @bullet
@item New `options()$STERM' in the S dialects (S, S-Plus, R).
The S program can determine the environment in which it is
currently running.  ESS sets the option to `iESS' or `ddeESS'
when it starts an S language process.  We recommend other specific
values for S language processes that ESS does not start.
@item New `ess-mouse-me' function, assigned to S-mouse-3 by default.
User may click on a word or region and then choose from the
menu to display the item, or a summary, or a plot, etc.
This feature is still under development.
@item GNU Emacs 21.1 is now supported (fixed for S dialects, SAS & BUGS),
(some from Stephen Eglen).
@item XEmacs 21.x is now supported (fixed w32-using-nt bug)
@item XEmacs on Win (NT) is better supported.
@item Workaround for bug in Sqpe+6 (S-PLUS 6 for Win).
@item should now work even when imenu is not available (for old XEmacsen).
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: XEmacs-Imenu fix; @kbd{C-TAB} is globalized along with your
function-key definitions, if specified; you can specify your SAS
library definitions outside of autoexec.sas for ess-sas-data-view
with SAS code placed in the variable ess-sas-data-view-libname,
also the dataset name is defaulted to the nearest permanent dataset
to point; Speedbar support now works for permanent datasets, please
ignore first./last.; new font-locking is now the default with more
improvements for font-locking PROCs, macro statements, * ; and %* ;
comments; you can toggle sas-log-mode with @kbd{F10} which will font-lock
your .log (if it isn't too big); submit remote .sas files accessed
with ange-ftp, EFS or Tramp (Kermit is experimental) by setting
ess-sas-submit-method to 'sh; ess-sas-submit-command and
ess-sas-submit-command-options are buffer-local so you can have
local file variable sections at the end of your .sas files to
request different executables or specify special options and the
local file variables are re-read at submit instead of only at file
open so that if you make a change it is picked up immediately;
@item @ESS{[BUGS]}: font-lock with `in' fixed.
@item for STATA: font-lock bug fixed.
@item for Rd mode: @kbd{C-c C-v} and `switch-process' in menu.
further, @kbd{C-c C-f} prefix (Rd-font) for inserting or surrounding a word
by things such as \code@{.@}, \code@{\link@{.@}@}, \emph@{.@} etc.
@item new functions (ess-directory-function) and (ess-narrow-to-defun)
ess-directory <-> default-directory logic (Jeff Mincy).
@item Re-organized Makefile and fixed a few bugs.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.1.19:
@itemize @bullet
@item S+6 now supported (Tony Rossini (Unix) and Rich Heiberger (Windows))
@item New BUGS support through @ESS{[BUGS]} mode (Rodney Sparapani)
Templates assist you in writing .bug and .cmd code (.cmd and .log
are replaced by .bmd and .bog to avoid emacs extension collisions).
Substitution" parameters facilitate "automagic" generation of
data...in" and "init...in" filenames, "const N=" from your data
file and "monitor()/stats()" commands.  Activated by pressing @kbd{F12}.
@item Fixes for `ess-smart-underscore' SAS breakage (Rich Heiberger)
@item You can change between PC and Unix, local and global SAS function-key
definitions interactively (Rich Heiberger)
@item @kbd{C-Submit} a highlighted region to SAS batch (Rodney Sparapani)
@item New and improved SAS syntax highlighting (Rodney Sparapani)
To get the new functionality, set ess-sas-run-make-regexp to nil.
Also available in .log files via @kbd{F10}.
@item Open a permanent SAS dataset for viewing via @kbd{F9} (Rodney Sparapani)
You must have the library defined in autoexec.sas for it to work.

and `ess-sas-batch-post-command' as well Customize support for these
and other @ESS{[SAS]} variables (Rodney Sparapani)

Changes/New Features in 5.1.2:
@itemize @bullet
@item  able to use inferior iESS mode to
communicate directly with a running S-Plus 4.x process using the
Microsoft DDE protocol.  We use the familiar (from Unix ESS) @kbd{C-c C-n}
and related key sequences to send lines from the S-mode file to the
inferior S process.  We continue to edit S input files in @ESS{[S]} mode
and transcripts of previous S sessions in ESS Transcript mode.  All
three modes know the S language, syntax, and indentation patterns and
provide the syntactic highlighting that eases the programming tasks.
