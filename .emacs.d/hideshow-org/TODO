* hideshow-org.el
** Need some better way of handling the documentation.  
   Right now it's duplicated in two places in two different formats:
   README.md and hideshow-org.el.  Violates the DRY principle.
*** Possible Solutions
**** Keep README
**** Generate README from initial comments.
** TODOs
  - [ ] ensure it works most of the time
  - [X] do a screencast
  - [X] fix up so it works with multiple keys
  - [ ] problem with java 

        It folds the whole class when you only want it to fold a
        method.  Actually, if one tabs near the curly brace, it'll
        fold the method.
  - [X] folds aren't remembered

        If I fold a method, then fold a class, when I unfold the
        class, it unfolds everything.
        
        Actually, hideshow.el does take care of this.  It's just not a
        custom variable, but if you add this to your .emacs, it'll
        work.

            (setq hs-allow-nesting t)

  - [ ] undo can change stuff inside a fold, which is kind of nasty
    behavior.  It should unfold if the text inside the changes.
  - [X] is hs-org/minor-mode a local buffer thing or not?  It is a
    local buffer thing now.
