If you need help, search the issue tracker to see if anyone has asked
your question before.  If it hasn't, a good place to ask first is our
chat room on [[https://gitter.im/vermiculus/sx.el][Gitter]].  Opening an issue is welcome of course, but chat
will likely be faster for you.  If a code change needs to be made, an
issue can be written up as necessary.

Have a great idea for SX?  Again, discuss it on [[https://gitter.im/vermiculus/sx.el][Gitter]] first!  Don't
limit ideas to mimicking the official website, either -- this is
Emacs; we should take advantage of its abilities.

To see what we're working on /right now/, check out our [[http://www.waffle.io/vermiculus/sx.el][Waffle board]].
If you would like to contribute, feel free to take on anything in the
=ready= Waffle column (or the [[https://github.com/vermiculus/sx.el/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aready+-label%3A%22in+progress%22][=ready= GitHub label]]).  These are issues
which have been discussed enough to provide a good idea of what should
be done.  Issues in =backlog= are either still under discussion or
simply are in the backlog.

Of course, the greatest gift you can give to SX is a good word.  Star
the project on GitHub, mention it to others who would use it in your
StackExchange chat rooms (as always, be courteous and respectful), and
use it yourself.

Enjoy!
