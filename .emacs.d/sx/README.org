SX is a full featured Stack Exchange mode for GNU Emacs 24+.  Using the official
API, it provides a versatile experience for the Stack Exchange network within
Emacs itself.

* Features
** Viewing Questions
View questions with one of the ~sx-tab-~ commands.  These translate to the
different 'tabs' that you can view on the official site.  Implemented tabs
include:
- =frontpage= :: The default front page of questions.
- =newest= :: Newest questions first.
- =topvoted= :: Highest-voted questions first.
- =hot= :: Questions with the most views, answers, and votes over the last few
           days.
- =week= :: Questions with the most views, answers, and votes this week.
- =month= :: Questions with the most views, answers, and votes this month.
The meaning of these tabs hopefully needs no explanation, but the official
behavior is given as a tooltip on any site in the StackExchange network.

Each of these opens up a list of questions.  Switch sites with =:=.  Navigate
this list of questions with =jk= or =np=.  =jk= will also view the question in a
separate buffer.  =v= will visit the question in your browser where =w= will
simply copy a link.  Upvote and downvote with =u= and =d=.  =RET= will take you
to the question buffer, where =RET= on headlines will expand and collapse each
section.  Add comments with =c=.

As always, =C-h m= is the definitive resource for the functions of this mode.

* Installation
To install the development version, follow the usual steps:
- Clone this repository
- Add this directory to your ~load-path~
- Issue ~(require 'sx-load)~
This should give you access to the ~sx-tab-~ functions (the main entry points at
this time).

If you are going to be doing any asking / answering / commenting / upvoting /
downvoting / /etc./, you must use ~sx-authenticate~ to provide SX with an
authentication token to act on your behalf.

Eventually, this package will be available on MELPA.

** Icons
SX has no explicit /need/ for an icon, although standard SVG files
have been gathered in =resources/= if anyone would fancy a crack at
it.
