- **A full explanation can be found in the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/bmag/emacs-purpose/wiki).**
- **Update: The package on Melpa was renamed from "purpose" to "window-purpose", and the files have been renamed accordingly.  Users should update their configurations to `(require 'window-purpose)` instead of `'purpose`.  The names of functions and variables remains unchanged.**

## Introduction

Purpose provides a new window management system for Emacs, which gives
you a better control over where Emacs displays buffers.

With Purpose, each buffer has a configurable "purpose" and each window
can interactivaly be dedicated to a certain "purpose". When you dedicate
a window (`C-c , d`), Purpose makes sure that this window will be used
only for buffers which have the same purpose as the buffer that is
currently displayed in that window. The purpose of a buffer can be
customized via the variables `purpose-user-mode-purposes`,
`purpose-user-name-purposes`, `purpose-user-regexp-purposes` and
`purpose-use-default-configuration` (see the
[wiki](https://github.com/bmag/emacs-purpose/wiki/Purpose-Configuration)).

## Quickstart

### Activate Purpose
Manually: `M-x purpose-mode`

In your init file:
```elisp
(require 'window-purpose)
(purpose-mode)
```

### Configure Purpose
Manually: `M-x customize-group purpose`. Look at:
- "Purpose User Mode Purposes": recognize purpose according to major mode
- "Purpose User Name Purposes": recognize purpose according to buffer
  name (for exact names)
- "Purpose User Regexp Purposes": recognize purpose according to buffer
  name (for name patterns)
- "Purpose Use Default Configuration": toggle default configuration
  on/off

In init file:
```elisp
(add-to-list 'purpose-user-mode-purposes '(<major-mode> . <purpose>))
(add-to-list 'purpose-user-name-purposes '(<name> . <purpose>))
(add-to-list 'purpose-user-regexp-purposes '(<pattern> . <purpose>))
(setq purpose-use-default-configuration t) ; not really necessary, default is t
(purpose-compile-user-configuration) ; activates your changes
```

### Example: Simple Python Layout
How to get a simple and persistent layout for coding in Python that
looks like this:

![simple python layout](https://github.com/bmag/emacs-purpose/blob/master/images/simple-python-layout.png)

#### step 1: configuration
```elisp
(add-to-list 'purpose-user-mode-purposes '(python-mode . py))
(add-to-list 'purpose-user-mode-purposes '(inferior-python-mode . py-repl))
(purpose-compile-user-configuration)
```

#### step 2: change window layout
If you have a previously saved layout, you can load it with
`purpose-load-window-layout` and skip step 2 and step 3.

1. open a Python file
2. `C-c , d` (`purpose-toggle-window-purpose-dedicated`) so window is
   dedicated ("[py]" in the status bar will change to "[py!]")
3. `C-x 1` (`delete-other-windows`)
4. `C-x 2` (`split-window-below`)
5. `C-c C-z` (`python-shell-switch-to-shell`)
6. `C-c , d` so window is dedicated
7. `C-x o` (`other-window`) to select the python file's window
8. `C-x ^` (`enlarge-window`) until you like the sizes of the windows

#### step 3: save window layout
`M-x purpose-save-window-layout`
