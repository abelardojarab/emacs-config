An auto-magical, =which-key= based =hydra= banisher.

* Overview
** Standalone
With almost no set-up code, =hercules.el= lets you call any group of
related command sequentially with no prefix keys, while showing a
handy popup to remember the bindings for those commands. =hercules.el=
can create both of these (the grouped commands, and the popup) from
any keymap. Here's what that looks like:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (hercules-def
   :toggle-funs #'macrostep-mode
   :keymap 'macrostep-keymap)
   
  (define-key <map> "<key>" #'macrostep-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Relative to Other Packages
If only there was a way to make a =hydra= without having to list all
the bindings explicitly... Kind of like =which-key=...

=hercules.el= implements the functionality of
[[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]] by leveraging
[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] auto-magic.

Unlike =hydra=, =hercules.el= entry and exit points are associated
with functions, not keys. Keys, on the other hand, are defined by
traditional keymaps, which you can use as-is, or tweak to your liking
using your tool of choice. =hercules.el= doesn't force this choice on
you. That said, I highly recommend
[[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]].

Ultimately, =hercules.el= saves you time by relying on work that has
already been done for you --- usually, but not necessarily, as part of
a time-tested minor-mode. The resulting interfaces tend to be more
comprehensive than home-grown =hydras=, thus aiding you in
discovering new functionality.

Allow me to illustrate my point using an example from =hydras= README:

*** Hydra Setup
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defhydra hydra-buffer-menu (:color pink
                               :hint nil)

    ("q" quit-window "quit" :color blue))

  (define-key Buffer-menu-mode-map "." 'hydra-buffer-menu/body)
#+END_SRC

*** hercules.el Setup
NOTE: This is the equivalent of hydra's buffer setup applied to window
manipulation, since I don't use buffer-menu. Implementing it yourself
should be trivial.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (hercules-def
   :show-funs #'windresize
   :hide-funs '(windresize-exit windresize-cancel-and-quit)
   :keymap 'windresize-map)
   
  (define-key <map> "<key>" #'windresize)
#+END_SRC

** Bonus
Last, and definitely least, =hercules.el= provides a more consistent
interface for all your keybinding popup needs (the same =which-key= UI
throughout your config).

* Motivation 
As mentioned, I initially wrote =hercules.el= to avoid reinventing the
wheel by creating elaborate hydras for minor-modes that already worked
like they had them, merely lacking the handy popup. These include:

- =macrostep-mode=
- =edebug-mode=
- =debugger-mode=
- =windresize=
- many more
  
But =hercules.el= can use any keymap you have lying around, even if
there's no mode associated with it. Just make one up. For example, you
can steal =org-babel-map= and whip up what used to be a massive
=hydra= in seconds:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (hercules-def
   :toggle-funs #'org-babel-mode
   :keymap 'org-babel-map
   :transient t)
   
  (define-key <map> "<key>" #'org-babel-mode)
#+END_SRC

Pressing any key outside the map will leave the pseudo-mode and hide
the =hercules.el= pop-up if *TRANSIENT* is =t=. But you can also use
the *HIDE-FUNS* and *TOGGLE-FUNS* arguments to do the same while
executing one last Hail Mary command. Combining them is not a problem
either.

Too crowded for you?

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (hercules-def
   :toggle-funs #'org-babel-mode
   :keymap 'org-babel-map
   :whitelist-keys '("n" "p" "t")
   :transient t)
   
  (define-key <map> "<key>" #'org-babel-mode)
#+END_SRC

You can also use *BLACKLIST-KEYS*, *BLACKLIST-FUNS*, and
*WHITELIST-FUNS*. to this end.

What about defining =hercules.el= pop-ups from scratch? Easy. Keep in
mind this would usually take 3 =defhydra= calls that would need to be
explicitly connected.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (hercules-def
   :toggle-funs #'my-random-mode
   :keymap 'my-random-map
   :transient t
   :config '(general-def
              :prefix-map 'my-random-map
              "f" #'foo
              "b" #'bar
              "z" #'baz
              "m" '(:ignore t :wk "mmap")
              "mf" #'mfoo
              "mb" #'mbar
              "mz" #'mbaz
              "n" '(:ignore t :wk "nmap")
              "nf" #'nfoo
              "nb" #'nbar
              "nz" #'nbaz))

  (define-key <map> "<key>" #'my-random-mode)
#+END_SRC

* Interface
The only userland function you should concern yourself with is
=hercules-def=. As such, you should get to know it well.

** Arguments
*TOGGLE-FUNS*, *SHOW-FUNS*, and *HIDE-FUNS* define entry and exit
points for hercules.el to show *KEYMAP*. Both single functions and
lists work. As all other arguments to =hercules-def=, these must be
quoted.

*KEYMAP* specifies the keymap for =hercules.el= to make a pop-up out
of.  If *KEYMAP* is =nil=, it is assumed that one of *SHOW-FUNS* or
*TOGGLE-FUNS* results in a =which-key--show-popup= call. This may be
useful for functions such as =which-key-show-top-level=. I use it to
remind myself of some obscure Evil commands from time to time.

*BLACKLIST-KEYS* and *WHITELIST-KEYS* specify which (=kbd=
interpretable) keys should removed from/allowed to remain on
*KEYMAP*. Handy if you want to unbind things in bulk and don't want to
get your hands dirty with keymaps. Both single characters and lists
work. Blacklists take precedence over whitelists.

*BLACKLIST-FUNS* and *WHITELIST-FUNS* are analogous to
*BLACKLIST-KEYS* and *WHITELIST-KEYS* except that they operate on
function symbols. These might be useful if a keymap specifies multiple
bindings for a commands and pruning it is more efficient this
way. Blacklists again take precedence over whitelists.

*PACKAGE* must be passed along with *BLACKLIST-KEYS*,
*WHITELIST-KEYS*, *BLACKLIST-FUNS*, or *WHITELIST-FUNS* if *KEYMAP*
belongs to a lazy loaded package. Its contents should be the package
name as a quoted symbol.

Setting *TRANSIENT* to =t= allows you to get away with not setting
*HIDE-FUNS* or *TOGGLE-FUNS* by dismissing hercules.el whenever you
press a key not on *KEYMAP*.

*CONFIG* is a quoted s-expression for the pedantic among us who would
like to keep related configurations together. This might be useful if
you wish to manually tweak *KEYMAP*, or even create a new one from
scratch.
