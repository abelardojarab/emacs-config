# ibuffer-vc: Group buffers in ibuffer list by VC project #

Emacs' `ibuffer-mode` is a wonderful replacement for the built-in
`list-buffer` command, and allows buffers to be grouped
programatically, e.g. by major mode.

If, like me, you mostly work on version-controlled files, you might
like to see your buffers grouped by the associated version control
project.

That's where `ibuffer-vc` comes in: it lets you:

* Group your buffers by their parent vc root directory
* See the VC status of the associated files
* Sort buffers by their VC status
