whitespace-cleanup-mode.el
==========================

This Emacs library minor mode will intelligently call `whitespace-cleanup`
before buffers are saved.

`whitespace-cleanup` is a handy function, but putting it in
`before-save-hook` for every buffer is overkill, and causes messy diffs
when editing third-party code that did not initially have clean whitespace.

Additionally, whitespace preferences are often project-specific, and
it's inconvenient to set up `before-save-hook` in a `.dir-locals.el` file.

`whitespace-cleanup-mode` is a minor mode which calls `whitespace-cleanup`
before saving the current buffer, but only if the whitespace in the buffer
was initially clean. It determines this by quickly checking to see if
`whitespace-cleanup` would have any effect on the buffer.


Installation
=============

If you choose not to use one of the convenient
packages in [Melpa][melpa] and [Marmalade][marmalade], you'll need to
add the directory containing `whitespace-cleanup-mode.el` to your `load-path`, and
then `(require 'whitespace-cleanup-mode)`.

Usage
=====

Enable `whitespace-cleanup-mode` in an individual buffer like this:

```
M-x whitespace-cleanup-mode
```

Optionally enable it everywhere by default using
`global-whitespace-cleanup-mode`. (You can override that by setting
`whitespace-cleanup-mode` to `nil` in file or directory local
variables.)

Alternatively, enable whitespace cleanup for a particular major mode:

```lisp
(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'whitespace-cleanup-mode)
```

To enable it for an entire project, set `whitespace-cleanup-mode` to `t` in
your `.dir-locals.el` file.

This mode is built upon some functionality built into `whitespace-mode`, namely
`whitespace-action`: if you would rather see a warning when saving a file with
bogus whitespace, or even have the save aborted, then set that variable.
