	* readme.texi/announc.texi: cosmetic changes to title

2013-07-01  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess.texi/allnews.texi: cosmetic changes to title

2013-06-28  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* help-sas.texi (ESS): convert ESS(SAS) to ESS[SAS]
	in the table of contents as was done for BUGS/JAGS
	however, this is not a complete solution since the
	nodes themselves are still named ESS(SAS)--...
	and there is no way to fix that, right?

2013-06-12  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* allnews.texi/Makefile (New features): All "new"
	features as discussed in ess-core; see below

2013-06-12  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess.texi/Makefile (New features): really "new" as
	discussed in ess-core; see below

2013-06-07  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* onewfeat.texi/newfeat.texi: migrated pre-12.03
	features to onewfeat.texi  However, this will have
	no practical effect until we stop including
	onewfeat.texi from ess.texi; see below

2013-04-11  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* onewfeat.texi/newfeat.texi: migrated pre-5.3.10 new
	features to old new features in accordance with downloads/OLD;
	but, I think we need to go further:  is "new" valid
	more than 2 years, i.e. 5.14+ (07/11)?  However, currently
	this migration has no practical effect since ess.texi includes
	both newfeat.texi and onewfeat.texi; does that really make sense?

2013-03-08  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* newfeat.texi:
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: long over-looked @code{SAS-mode-hook} appears!

2013-02-25  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* Makefile: ignore warnings from makeinfo

2013-01-23  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* currfeat.texi: cleaning up the language
	in Languages Supported...
	S family (R and S+ AKA S-PLUS)

2012-07-06  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess.texi (ESS tracebug): just trying to
	see what would make the tracebug key
	tables look right

	* credits.texi: fixed a typo
