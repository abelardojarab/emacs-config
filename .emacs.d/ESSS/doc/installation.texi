@enumerate
@item Download the latest zip or tgz archive from ESS 
@uref{http://ess.r-project.org/index.php?Section=download, downloads
area} and unpack it into a directory where you would like ESS to
reside. We will denote this directory as @file{/path/to/ESS/} hereafter.

Alternatively you can use @code{git} to fetch the most
recent development version to your local machine with:
@comment 
@comment @example
@comment svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk /path/to/ESS
@comment @end example
@comment 
@comment or 

@example
git clone https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS.git /path/to/ESS
@end example

@item @b{Optionally}, compile elisp files and build the documentation with:
@example
cd /path/to/ESS/
make
@end example
Without this step, info, pdf and html documentation and reference card
will not be available.

@item @b{Optionally}, install into your local machine with
@code{make install}. You might need administrative privileges:

@example
make install
@end example

The files are installed into @code{/usr/share/emacs} directory. For this step to
run correctly on Mac OS X, you will need to adjust the @file{PREFIX}
path in @file{Makeconf}. The necessary code and instructions are
commented in that file.

@item If you have performed the @code{make install} step from above, just add

@example
(require 'ess-site)
@end example

to your @file{~/.emacs} file. Otherwise, you should add
@file{/path/to/ESS/lisp/} to your emacs load path and then load ESS with
the following lines in your @file{~/.emacs}:

@example
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ESS/lisp/")
(load "ess-site")
@end example

@item Restart your Emacs and check that ESS was loaded from a correct
location with @code{M-x ess-version}.
@end enumerate


@emph{Note for Windows and Mac OS X users:} The most straightforward
way to install Emacs on your machine is by downloading
@uref{http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/emacs/, all-in-one} Emacs binary
by Vincent Goulet.


@emph{Note for XEmacs users:} Due to XEmacs lacking some features
that ESS requires, ESS support of XEmacs ends with ESS 12.04-4.  This
decision will be re-visited in the future as XEmacs continues to sync
with GNU Emacs.
