;;; Commentary:

;; This mode is fully documented in the Emacs user's manual.
;;
;; This was designed and implemented by Eric Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>.
;; Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com>, Sebastian Kremer <sk@thp.uni-koeln.de>,
;; and Richard Stallman contributed valuable criticism, support, and testing.
;; CVS support was added by Per Cederqvist <ceder@lysator.liu.se>
;; in Jan-Feb 1994.  Further enhancements came from ttn@netcom.com and
;; Andre Spiegel <spiegel@inf.fu-berlin.de>.
;;
;; Supported version-control systems presently include SCCS, RCS, and CVS.
;;
;; Some features will not work with old RCS versions.  Where
;; appropriate, VC finds out which version you have, and allows or
;; disallows those features (stealing locks, for example, works only 
;; from 5.6.2 onwards).
;; Even initial checkins will fail if your RCS version is so old that ci
;; doesn't understand -t-; this has been known to happen to people running
;; NExTSTEP 3.0. 
;;
;; You can support the RCS -x option by adding pairs to the 
;; vc-master-templates list.
;;
;; Proper function of the SCCS diff commands requires the shellscript vcdiff
;; to be installed somewhere on Emacs's path for executables.
;;
;; If your site uses the ChangeLog convention supported by Emacs, the
;; function vc-comment-to-change-log should prove a useful checkin hook.
;;
;; This code depends on call-process passing back the subprocess exit
;; status.  Thus, you need Emacs 18.58 or later to run it.  For the
;; vc-directory command to work properly as documented, you need 19.
;; You also need Emacs 19's ring.el.
;;
;; The vc code maintains some internal state in order to reduce expensive
;; version-control operations to a minimum.  Some names are only computed
;; once.  If you perform version control operations with RCS/SCCS/CVS while
;; vc's back is turned, or move/rename master files while vc is running,
;; vc may get seriously confused.  Don't do these things!
;;
;; Developer's notes on some concurrency issues are included at the end of
;; the file.
;;
;; Synchronicity notes:
;; * We reuse the CVS property 'vc-cvs-status instead of renaming it
;;   vc-sync-status so that we can reuse more CVS code.
;; * We require that 'vc-sync-work-style be set.  We need to know, from
;;   the up-to-date state, do we do nothing or do we 'co -lock'?  There
;;   may be other reasons too...the 'vc-checkout-model property is used
;;   in many places.  I thought we could auto-detect the work style, but
;;   the presence of the FetchReadOnly=1 registry setting is only an
;;   indicator of the locking work style, and isn't sufficient.  For
;;   instance, our docs group uses the locking work style but not
;;   FetchReadOnly.  In any case, reading the reg setting would take two
;;   exec's, regmod -u and regmod -m, and it could be slow.

  "Do the next logical checkin or checkout operation on the current file.
   If you call this from within a VC dired buffer with no files marked,
it will operate on the file in the current line.
   If you call this from within a VC dired buffer, and one or more
files are marked, it will accept a log message and then operate on
each one.  The log message will be used as a comment for any register
or checkin operations, but ignored when doing checkouts.  Attempted
lock steals will raise an error.
   A prefix argument lets you specify the version number to use.

For RCS and SCCS files:
   If the file is not already registered, this registers it for version
control.
   If the file is registered and not locked by anyone, this checks out
a writable and locked file ready for editing.
   If the file is checked out and locked by the calling user, this
first checks to see if the file has changed since checkout.  If not,
it performs a revert.
   If the file has been changed, this pops up a buffer for entry
of a log message; when the message has been entered, it checks in the
resulting changes along with the log message as change commentary.  If
the variable `vc-keep-workfiles' is non-nil (which is its default), a
read-only copy of the changed file is left in place afterwards.
   If the file is registered and locked by someone else, you are given
the option to steal the lock.

For CVS files:
   If the file is not already registered, this registers it for version
control.  This does a \"cvs add\", but no \"cvs commit\".
   If the file is added but not committed, it is committed.
   If your working file is changed, but the repository file is
unchanged, this pops up a buffer for entry of a log message; when the
message has been entered, it checks in the resulting changes along
with the logmessage as change commentary.  A writable file is retained.
   If the repository file is changed, you are asked if you want to
merge in the changes into your working copy."

  "Minor mode for driving version-control tools.
These bindings are added to the global keymap when you enter this mode:
\\[vc-next-action]		perform next logical version-control operation on current file
\\[vc-register]			register current file
\\[vc-toggle-read-only]		like next-action, but won't register files
\\[vc-insert-headers]		insert version-control headers in current file
\\[vc-print-log]		display change history of current file
\\[vc-revert-buffer]		revert buffer to latest version
\\[vc-cancel-version]		undo latest checkin
\\[vc-diff]		show diffs between file versions
\\[vc-version-other-window]		visit old version in another window
\\[vc-directory]		show all files locked by any user in or below .
\\[vc-annotate]		colorful display of the cvs annotate command 
\\[vc-update-change-log]		add change log entry from recent checkins

While you are entering a change log message for a version, the following
additional bindings will be in effect.

\\[vc-finish-logentry]	proceed with check in, ending log message entry

Whenever you do a checkin, your log comment is added to a ring of
saved comments.  These can be recalled as follows:

\\[vc-next-comment]	replace region with next message in comment ring
\\[vc-previous-comment]	replace region with previous message in comment ring
\\[vc-comment-search-reverse]	search backward for regexp in the comment ring
\\[vc-comment-search-forward]	search backward for regexp in the comment ring

Entry to the change-log submode calls the value of text-mode-hook, then
the value of vc-log-mode-hook.

Global user options:
	vc-initial-comment	If non-nil, require user to enter a change
				comment upon first checkin of the file.

	vc-keep-workfiles	Non-nil value prevents workfiles from being
				deleted when changes are checked in

        vc-suppress-confirm     Suppresses some confirmation prompts,
				notably for reversions.

	vc-header-alist		Which keywords to insert when adding headers
				with \\[vc-insert-headers].  Defaults to
				'(\"\%\W\%\") under SCCS, '(\"\$Id\$\") under 
				RCS and CVS.

	vc-static-header-alist	By default, version headers inserted in C files
				get stuffed in a static string area so that
				ident(RCS/CVS) or what(SCCS) can see them in
				the compiled object code.  You can override
				this by setting this variable to nil, or change
				the header template by changing it.

	vc-command-messages	if non-nil, display run messages from the
				actual version-control utilities (this is
				intended primarily for people hacking vc
				itself).

	vc-debug		If non-nil, log debug messages to the
				*vc-debug* buffer.  This is intended for
				people hacking vc and those helping debug it.

;;; DEVELOPER'S NOTES ON CONCURRENCY PROBLEMS IN THIS CODE
;;;
;;; These may be useful to anyone who has to debug or extend the package.
;;; (Note that this information corresponds to versions 5.x. Some of it
;;; might have been invalidated by the additions to support branching
;;; and RCS keyword lookup. AS, 1995/03/24)
;;; 
;;; A fundamental problem in VC is that there are time windows between
;;; vc-next-action's computations of the file's version-control state and
;;; the actions that change it.  This is a window open to lossage in a
;;; multi-user environment; someone else could nip in and change the state
;;; of the master during it.
;;; 
;;; The performance problem is that rlog/prs calls are very expensive; we want
;;; to avoid them as much as possible.
;;; 
;;; ANALYSIS:
;;; 
;;; The performance problem, it turns out, simplifies in practice to the
;;; problem of making vc-locking-user fast.  The two other functions that call
;;; prs/rlog will not be so commonly used that the slowdown is a problem; one
;;; makes snapshots, the other deletes the calling user's last change in the
;;; master.
;;; 
;;; The race condition implies that we have to either (a) lock the master
;;; during the entire execution of vc-next-action, or (b) detect and
;;; recover from errors resulting from dispatch on an out-of-date state.
;;; 
;;; Alternative (a) appears to be infeasible.  The problem is that we can't
;;; guarantee that the lock will ever be removed.  Suppose a user starts a
;;; checkin, the change message buffer pops up, and the user, having wandered
;;; off to do something else, simply forgets about it?
;;; 
;;; Alternative (b), on the other hand, works well with a cheap way to speed up
;;; vc-locking-user.  Usually, if a file is registered, we can read its locked/
;;; unlocked state and its current owner from its permissions.
;;; 
;;; This shortcut will fail if someone has manually changed the workfile's
;;; permissions; also if developers are munging the workfile in several
;;; directories, with symlinks to a master (in this latter case, the
;;; permissions shortcut will fail to detect a lock asserted from another
;;; directory).
;;; 
;;; Note that these cases correspond exactly to the errors which could happen
;;; because of a competing checkin/checkout race in between two instances of
;;; vc-next-action.
;;; 
;;; For VC's purposes, a workfile/master pair may have the following states:
;;; 
;;; A. Unregistered.  There is a workfile, there is no master.
;;; 
;;; B. Registered and not locked by anyone.
;;; 
;;; C. Locked by calling user and unchanged.
;;; 
;;; D. Locked by the calling user and changed.
;;; 
;;; E. Locked by someone other than the calling user.
;;; 
;;; This makes for 25 states and 20 error conditions.  Here's the matrix:
;;; 
;;; VC's idea of state
;;;  |
;;;  V  Actual state   RCS action              SCCS action          Effect
;;;    A  B  C  D  E
;;;  A .  1  2  3  4   ci -u -t-          admin -fb -i<file>      initial admin
;;;  B 5  .  6  7  8   co -l              get -e                  checkout
;;;  C 9  10 .  11 12  co -u              unget; get              revert
;;;  D 13 14 15 .  16  ci -u -m<comment>  delta -y<comment>; get  checkin
;;;  E 17 18 19 20 .   rcs -u -M -l       unget -n ; get -g       steal lock
;;; 
;;; All commands take the master file name as a last argument (not shown).
;;; 
;;; In the discussion below, a "self-race" is a pathological situation in
;;; which VC operations are being attempted simultaneously by two or more
;;; Emacsen running under the same username.
;;; 
;;; The vc-next-action code has the following windows:
;;; 
;;; Window P:
;;;    Between the check for existence of a master file and the call to
;;; admin/checkin in vc-buffer-admin (apparent state A).  This window may
;;; never close if the initial-comment feature is on.
;;; 
;;; Window Q:
;;;    Between the call to vc-workfile-unchanged-p in and the immediately
;;; following revert (apparent state C).
;;; 
;;; Window R:
;;;    Between the call to vc-workfile-unchanged-p in and the following
;;; checkin (apparent state D).  This window may never close.
;;; 
;;; Window S:
;;;    Between the unlock and the immediately following checkout during a
;;; revert operation (apparent state C).  Included in window Q.
;;; 
;;; Window T:
;;;    Between vc-locking-user and the following checkout (apparent state B).
;;; 
;;; Window U:
;;;    Between vc-locking-user and the following revert (apparent state C).
;;; Includes windows Q and S.
;;; 
;;; Window V:
;;;    Between vc-locking-user and the following checkin (apparent state
;;; D).  This window may never be closed if the user fails to complete the
;;; checkin message.  Includes window R.
;;; 
;;; Window W:
;;;    Between vc-locking-user and the following steal-lock (apparent
;;; state E).  This window may never close if the user fails to complete
;;; the steal-lock message.  Includes window X.
;;; 
;;; Window X:
;;;    Between the unlock and the immediately following re-lock during a
;;; steal-lock operation (apparent state E).  This window may never cloce
;;; if the user fails to complete the steal-lock message.
;;; 
;;; Errors:
;;; 
;;; Apparent state A ---
;;;
;;; 1. File looked unregistered but is actually registered and not locked.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: someone else's admin during window P, with
;;; caller's admin happening before their checkout.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: Prior to version 5.6.4, ci fails with message
;;;         "no lock set by <user>".  From 5.6.4 onwards, VC uses the new
;;;         ci -i option and the message is "<file>,v: already exists".
;;;    SCCS: admin will fail with error (ad19).
;;; 
;;;    We can let these errors be passed up to the user.
;;; 
;;; 2. File looked unregistered but is actually locked by caller, unchanged.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: self-race during window P.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: Prior to version 5.6.4, reverts the file to the last saved
;;;         version and unlocks it.  From 5.6.4 onwards, VC uses the new
;;;         ci -i option, failing with message "<file>,v: already exists".
;;;    SCCS: will fail with error (ad19).
;;; 
;;;    Either of these consequences is acceptable.
;;; 
;;; 3. File looked unregistered but is actually locked by caller, changed.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: self-race during window P.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: Prior to version 5.6.4, VC registers the caller's workfile as 
;;;         a delta with a null change comment (the -t- switch will be 
;;;         ignored). From 5.6.4 onwards, VC uses the new ci -i option,
;;;         failing with message "<file>,v: already exists".
;;;    SCCS: will fail with error (ad19).
;;; 
;;; 4. File looked unregistered but is locked by someone else.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: someone else's admin during window P, with
;;; caller's admin happening *after* their checkout.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: Prior to version 5.6.4, ci fails with a 
;;;         "no lock set by <user>" message.  From 5.6.4 onwards, 
;;;         VC uses the new ci -i option, failing with message 
;;;         "<file>,v: already exists".
;;;    SCCS: will fail with error (ad19).
;;; 
;;;    We can let these errors be passed up to the user.
;;; 
;;; Apparent state B ---
;;;
;;; 5. File looked registered and not locked, but is actually unregistered.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: master file got nuked during window P.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: will fail with "RCS/<file>: No such file or directory"
;;;    SCCS: will fail with error ut4.
;;; 
;;;    We can let these errors be passed up to the user.
;;; 
;;; 6. File looked registered and not locked, but is actually locked by the
;;; calling user and unchanged.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: self-race during window T.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: in the same directory as the previous workfile, co -l will fail
;;; with "co error: writable foo exists; checkout aborted".  In any other
;;; directory, checkout will succeed.
;;;    SCCS: will fail with ge17.
;;; 
;;;    Either of these consequences is acceptable.
;;; 
;;; 7. File looked registered and not locked, but is actually locked by the
;;; calling user and changed.
;;; 
;;;    As case 6.
;;; 
;;; 8. File looked registered and not locked, but is actually locked by another
;;; user.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: someone else checks it out during window T.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: co error: revision 1.3 already locked by <user>
;;;    SCCS: fails with ge4 (in directory) or ut7 (outside it).
;;; 
;;;    We can let these errors be passed up to the user.
;;; 
;;; Apparent state C ---
;;;
;;; 9. File looks locked by calling user and unchanged, but is unregistered.
;;; 
;;;    As case 5.
;;; 
;;; 10. File looks locked by calling user and unchanged, but is actually not
;;; locked.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: a self-race in window U, or by the revert's
;;; landing during window X of some other user's steal-lock or window S
;;; of another user's revert.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: succeeds, refreshing the file from the identical version in
;;; the master.
;;;    SCCS: fails with error ut4 (p file nonexistent).
;;;
;;;    Either of these consequences is acceptable.
;;; 
;;; 11. File is locked by calling user.  It looks unchanged, but is actually
;;; changed.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: the file would have to be touched by a self-race
;;; during window Q.
;;; 
;;;    The revert will succeed, removing whatever changes came with
;;; the touch.  It is theoretically possible that work could be lost.
;;; 
;;; 12. File looks like it's locked by the calling user and unchanged, but
;;; it's actually locked by someone else.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: a steal-lock in window V.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: co error: revision <rev> locked by <user>; use co -r or rcs -u
;;;    SCCS: fails with error un2
;;; 
;;;    We can pass these errors up to the user.
;;; 
;;; Apparent state D ---
;;;
;;; 13. File looks like it's locked by the calling user and changed, but it's
;;; actually unregistered.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: master file got nuked during window P.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: Prior to version 5.6.4, checks in the user's version as an 
;;;         initial delta.  From 5.6.4 onwards, VC uses the new ci -j
;;;         option, failing with message "no such file or directory".
;;;    SCCS: will fail with error ut4.
;;;
;;;    This case is kind of nasty.  Under RCS prior to version 5.6.4,
;;; VC may fail to detect the loss of previous version information.
;;; 
;;; 14. File looks like it's locked by the calling user and changed, but it's
;;; actually unlocked.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: self-race in window V, or the checkin happening
;;; during the window X of someone else's steal-lock or window S of
;;; someone else's revert.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: ci will fail with "no lock set by <user>".
;;;    SCCS: delta will fail with error ut4.
;;; 
;;; 15. File looks like it's locked by the calling user and changed, but it's
;;; actually locked by the calling user and unchanged.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: another self-race --- a whole checkin/checkout
;;; sequence by the calling user would have to land in window R.
;;; 
;;;    SCCS: checks in a redundant delta and leaves the file unlocked as usual.
;;;    RCS: reverts to the file state as of the second user's checkin, leaving
;;; the file unlocked.
;;;
;;;    It is theoretically possible that work could be lost under RCS.
;;; 
;;; 16. File looks like it's locked by the calling user and changed, but it's
;;; actually locked by a different user.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: ci error: no lock set by <user>
;;;    SCCS: unget will fail with error un2
;;; 
;;;    We can pass these errors up to the user.
;;; 
;;; Apparent state E ---
;;;
;;; 17. File looks like it's locked by some other user, but it's actually
;;; unregistered.
;;; 
;;;    As case 13.
;;; 
;;; 18. File looks like it's locked by some other user, but it's actually
;;; unlocked.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: someone released a lock during window W.
;;; 
;;;    RCS: The calling user will get the lock on the file.
;;;    SCCS: unget -n will fail with cm4.
;;; 
;;;    Either of these consequences will be OK.
;;; 
;;; 19. File looks like it's locked by some other user, but it's actually
;;; locked by the calling user and unchanged.
;;; 
;;;    Potential cause: the other user relinquishing a lock followed by
;;; a self-race, both in window W.
;;; 
;;;     Under both RCS and SCCS, both unlock and lock will succeed, making
;;; the sequence a no-op.
;;; 
;;; 20. File looks like it's locked by some other user, but it's actually
;;; locked by the calling user and changed.
;;; 
;;;     As case 19.
;;; 
;;; PROBLEM CASES:
;;; 
;;;    In order of decreasing severity:
;;; 
;;;    Cases 11 and 15 are the only ones that potentially lose work.
;;; They would require a self-race for this to happen.
;;; 
;;;    Case 13 in RCS loses information about previous deltas, retaining
;;; only the information in the current workfile.  This can only happen
;;; if the master file gets nuked in window P.
;;; 
;;;    Case 3 in RCS and case 15 under SCCS insert a redundant delta with
;;; no change comment in the master.  This would require a self-race in
;;; window P or R respectively.
;;; 
;;;    Cases 2, 10, 19 and 20 do extra work, but make no changes.
;;; 
;;;    Unfortunately, it appears to me that no recovery is possible in these
;;; cases.  They don't yield error messages, so there's no way to tell that
;;; a race condition has occurred.
;;; 
;;;    All other cases don't change either the workfile or the master, and
;;; trigger command errors which the user will see.
;;; 
;;;    Thus, there is no explicit recovery code.
