	* vc.el (vc-backend-assign-name): Fixed backend of vc snapshot
	(tag).  It not efficient, it would be better to use 'tag -rec',
	but it works.  Ticket 12270.

-------------- DesignSync40_emacs_20031231.tar.gz released -----------------

2003-12-22  Ken Cox  <ken@paganini>

	* vc.el (vc-resolve-conflicts): Now vc-resolve-conflicts works
	with DesignSync conflict markers.

-------------- DesignSync40_emacs_20031215.tar.gz released -----------------

2003-12-11    <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* designsync.el: Set vc-master-templates explicitly, don't use
	add-to-list, because in my Windows emacs-21.2.1 which I got
	precompiled, vc-master-templates is bound and it is nil!?@

2003-12-11  Ken Cox  <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* vc.el (vc-sync-ensure-syncd): Fixed a hang on some platforms
	when calling a DesignSync operation with no syncd running.  Now we
	ensure syncd is running by attempting to spawn it once per emacs
	session.  No harm done and trivial delay if it's already running. 

-------------- DesignSync40_emacs_20031210.tar.gz released -----------------

2003-12-10  Ken Cox  <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* vc.el:
	* vc-hooks.el: Use (featurep 'xemacs) to detect XEmacs.

2003-12-10  Ken Cox  <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* designsync.el: Created this loader file to simplify internal and
	external distribution.  Now the one file provides support for GNU
	Emacs 20, 21, and XEmacs 21.

2003-12-09    <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* vc.el (vc-backend-merge-news): Updated code to deal with
	merge messages which changed in rel40.

2003-12-09  Ken Cox  <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* vc.el: 
	* vc-hooks.el: Merged my forked version with XEmacs' forked
	version.  This merged version will work with both XEmacs-21 and
	Emacs-20.  Why the heck am I doing all this extra work for XEmacs?
	Will it make my life miserable trying to reconcile the
	irreconcilable?  I dunno...I like XEmacs.

-------------- DesignSync40_emacs20_20031205.tar.gz released -----------------

2003-12-09  Ken Cox  <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* vc-hooks.el (vc-find-sync-master): Updated code to work with
	DesignSync 4.0 and released as a separate package.


-------------------------- 20011002 released ---------------------------------

2001-10-02    <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* vc-hooks.el (vc-toggle-read-only): Changed it so DesignSync
	merging style does not use vc-next-action.  Instead, let it fall
	through to (toggle-read-only).  Requested by Dave Finnegan.

-------------------------- 20010228 released ---------------------------------

2001-02-01    <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* vc.el: Fixed defect: when using the merging work style,
	vc-revert-buffer (C-x v u) fails trying to do a "dss cancel".  Now
	it does "dss co -force".

2000-12-18    <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* Added KPS section to README.html.

-------------------------- 20001203 released ---------------------------------

2000-12-03    <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* Settled on DS-like naming convention with date in file name.

	* vc.el (vc-backend-diff): Now fakes "status" return by parsing
	the "N Differences detected" output.  This is necessary because
	"dss diff" at 3.0 exits 0 even when there are diffs.  This fixed
	the defect:
	- turn on "checkin comment required" with 20 chars min
	- modify file
	- checkin file with comment "."; this gives an error
	- but now "C-x v =" says "no changes" even though there are changes

2000-11-17    <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* vc.el: Removed three debug msgs.
	
-------------------------- i2 ------------------------------------------------

2000-11-11    <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* vc-hooks.el: Removed debugging messages and vars.

	* vc.el: Changed snapshot so that it uses "tag -force".  Since
	snapshot works a file at a time, the other lousy option for
	reusing a tag was to tag some files and then fail when we hit a
	file that already had the tag.

2000-11-10    <ken.cox@matrixone.com>

	* vc.el: Implemented vc-annotate (C-x v g).  Check it out!
	* vc.el: Implemented vc-rename-file for DSS.

-------------------------- first release (i1) --------------------------------
