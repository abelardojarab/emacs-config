2015-01-02 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	Unify tail of `browse-kill-ring-finish' and
	`browse-kill-ring-abort' to increase code reuse.  Improve use of
	`brose-kill-ring-edit-target' to track when the user is making an
	edit.

2014-11-04 Toon Claes <toon@tonotdo.com>
	v2.0 release:
	Legacy code is removed, README is converted and
	all issues on GitHub are closed.

2014-09-15 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	When editing entries from the *Kill Ring* buffer, reducing the
	entry to the empty string will cause the item to be deleted from
	the kill-ring once the edit is complete.

2014-09-11 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	Fix for http://bugs.debian.org/224751, inhibit all read only
	properties before trying to delete an entry from the *Kill Ring*
	buffer.

2014-09-08 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	Fix bug in `browse-kill-ring-occur' due to change in parameters of
	`browse-kill-ring-setup'.

2014-09-07 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	Perform the quit action early, causing the `*Kill Ring*' buffer to
	close before inserting the item.  This gives a better user
	experience when the inserted item is being highlighted, previously
	the highlighting would keep the *Kill Ring* buffer around for 0.5
	second acter the user has pressed the insert key, making it appear
	that `browse-kill-ring' was slow to respond.

2014-09-06 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	Register a `kill-buffer-hook' to ensure that the preview is
	removed even if the `*Kill Ring*' bufer is killed in an unexpected
	way, that is, by not calling `browse-kill-ring-quit' but calling
	`kill-buffer' directly.

2014-09-03 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	Disable the preview overlay before inserting the item from the
	`kill-ring', then reenable once the item has been inserted, moving
	the preview as appropriate, this ensures that when inserting
	multiple items the preview continues to be useful.

2014-09-03 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	When editing an item from the `kill-ring', if the preview is
	turned on, then update the preview live while the edit is being
	made.

2014-09-03 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	Split `browse-kill-ring-preview-update' into two functions so the
	new worker code, `browse-kill-ring-preview-update-text' can be
	reused in the next commit.  No user visible change from this.

2014-09-03 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	When deleting the last item in the *Kill Ring* buffer, also delete
	the preceding separator.

2014-09-01 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	After editing entries from the `*Kill Ring*' reselect the item in
	the `*Kill Ring*' buffer.

2014-09-01 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	Factor out code from `browse-kill-ring' to find a matching entry
	in the `kill-ring' creating `browse-kill-ring-find-entry', this
	will be used in a later commit.  Should be no user visible changes
	from this commit.

2014-09-01 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	When editing entries in the `kill-ring' place a header line in the
	edit buffer with a short key guide.  Kill the edit buffer when
	editing is finished rather than just burying it.  Add an abort key
	mapping to allow the edit buffer to be closed without saving the
	changes.

2014-09-01 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	Adjust mechanism used to restore buffer and window before
	inserting items from the `kill-ring', this should resolve issues
	when there are multiple frames or windows open onto the same
	buffer with different values for point.

2014-08-29 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	Remove `browse-kill-ring-highlight-inserted-item-style' and
	instead allow `browse-kill-ring-highlight-inserted-item' to take
	the value `pulse' or `solid' as well as `nil' and `t'.  It's type
	is changed to `choice' accordingly.  The value `t' now means use
	the default highlight style, which is currently `pulse', `nil'
	still means turn off highlighting of inserted items.

2014-08-25 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	Highlighting of the current entry in the *Kill Ring* buffer now
	works with manual point movement rather than just with the
	`browse-kill-ring-forward' function.  Also moving the point with
	the mouse will also update the highlighting correctly now.

2014-08-20 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	Added variable `browse-kill-ring-highlight-inserted-item-style'
	which selects the style to use when highlighting the inserted kill
	ring item.  The choices are `solid' (the old style, solid face for
	0.5 seconds) and `pulse' (which uses the pulse library from cedet,
	included with recent versions of emacs, to fade the highlighting
	out over 0.5 seconds).  The default is `pulse' but this will fall
	back to `solid' if the pulse library is not available.

2014-08-18 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>
	(browse-kill-ring-setup) Don't access
	browse-kill-ring-preview-overlay, or use
	browse-kill-ring-preview-update when preview is turned off.

2014-08-11 Bozhidar Batsov <bozhidar@batsov.com>

	Update package URL.
	Drop legacy xemacs code.
	Remove some redundant legacy code.
	Convert the readme to markdown and improve it.
	Simplify a bit of code.

2014-08-07 Andrew Burgess <andrew.burgess@embecosm.com>

	Handle case where kill-ring-yank-pointer is nil (empty kill ring).

2014-01-04 Toon Claes <toon@tonotdo.com>

	Use Semantic Versioning (www.semver.org) from now.

	Move ChangeLog to seperate file.

2013-11-17 skyer9 <skyer9 at gmail dot com>

	Works with `delete-selection-mode'.

	Modify `save-and-restore' option when exit.
	If Emacs version is 24+, browse-kill-ring works with `query-replace' properly.

	Works with kill-ring-yank-pointer.
	When kill is yanked by browse-kill-ring,
	browse-kill-ring remembers cursor position.

	Add `browse-kill-ring-display-leftmost-duplicate' variable.
	When `browse-kill-ring-display-duplicates' is nil,
	leftmost(last) duplicate will be displayed.

	Some bug fix.

2013-08-10 Ethan Glasser-Camp

	Fix browse-kill-ring-update. Commit ca0b5f4 broke it. Fixing it
	also exposed some problems with how the overlay is handled.

2013-07-29 Ethan Glasser-Camp

	Make `browse-kill-ring-quit-action' default to
	`save-and-restore'. This seems to DWIM in most cases: running
	browse-kill-ring with only one window and then pressing q will
	close that window, but if you have two windows open when you run
	browse-kill-ring, it will restore the windows you had open. For
	more information and history, see
	https://github.com/browse-kill-ring/browse-kill-ring/issues/11.

2013-01-19 Ethan Glasser-Camp

	browse-kill-ring-mode now uses an overlay to show what your
	buffer would look like if you inserted the current item.

2013-01-02 Ethan Glasser-Camp

	Fix a bug with default faces used to highlight items.
	The symbols browse-kill-ring-current-entry-face and
	browse-kill-ring-inserted-item-face are now treated like
	variables specifying a face instead of faces themselves. If you
	defined faces with these names, you will need to set the symbols
	(as variables) to the names of the faces you defined.

	(setq browse-kill-ring-current-entry-face 'browse-kill-ring-current-entry-face)

	Fix another bug with highlighting inserted items. (Previously, it
	highlighted arbitrary and incorrect parts of the buffer.)

	Add custom variable browse-kill-ring-replace-yank. When t, this
	makes browse-kill-ring after a yank replace the yanked text, like
	yank-pop.

	Refactor browse-kill-ring-do-prepend-insert,
	browse-kill-ring-do-append-insert, and browse-kill-ring-do-insert
	to all call the same function to do the actual inserting.


16-08-2012 Toon Claes

	No actual changes to the code, but released again by the
	browse-kill-ring user at Github.com.

28-02-2011 Andrew Burgess <aburgess@broadcom.com>

	Fix a bug where having other overlays active in the kill ring buffer,
	for example with show-paren-mode would block insertion.

24-02-2011 Andrew Burgess <aburgess@broadcom.com>

	Correctly handle inserting when multiple windows exist for the
	same buffer.

2009-01-20 Benjamin Andresen <bandresen@gmail.com>

	Added the read-only bugfix (http://bugs.debian.org/225082) from
	the emacs-goodies-el package

no-date Nick Hurley <hurley@cis.ohio-state.edu>

	Changes from 1.2 to 1.3:
	* New maintainer, Nick Hurley <hurley@cis.ohio-state.edu>
	* New functions `browse-kill-ring-prepend-insert', and
	`browse-kill-ring-append-insert', bound to 'b' and 'a' by
	default. There are also the unbound functions
	`browse-kill-ring-prepend-insert-and-quit',
	`browse-kill-ring-prepend-insert-and-move',
	`browse-kill-ring-prepend-insert-move-and-quit',
	`browse-kill-ring-append-insert-and-quit',
	`browse-kill-ring-append-insert-and-move',
	`browse-kill-ring-append-insert-move-and-quit'.

no-date Colin Walters

	Changes from 1.1 to 1.2:
	* New variable `browse-kill-ring-resize-window', which controls
	whether or not the browse-kill-ring window will try to resize
	itself to fit the buffer.  Implementation from Juanma Barranquero
	<lektu@terra.es>.
	* New variable `browse-kill-ring-highlight-inserted-item'.
	Implementation from Yasutaka SHINDOH <ring-pub@fan.gr.jp>.
	* `browse-kill-ring-mouse-insert' (normally bound to mouse-2) now
	calls `browse-kill-ring-quit'.
	* Some non-user-visible code cleanup.
	* New variable `browse-kill-ring-recenter', implementation from
	René Kyllingstad <kyllingstad@users.sourceforge.net>.
	* Patch from Michal Maršuka <mmc@maruska.dyndns.org> which handles
	read-only text better.
	* New ability to move unkilled entries back to the beginning of the
	ring; patch from Yasutaka SHINDOH <ring-pub@fan.gr.jp>.
	* Do nothing if the user invokes `browse-kill-ring' when we're
	already in a *Kill Ring* buffer (initial patch from Juanma
	Barranquero <lektu@terra.es>).

	Changes from 1.0 to 1.1:
	* Important keybinding change!  The default bindings of RET and 'i'
	have switched; this means typing RET now by default inserts the
	text and calls `browse-kill-ring-quit'; 'i' just inserts.
	* The variable `browse-kill-ring-use-fontification' is gone;
	browse-kill-ring.el has been rewritten to use font-lock.  XEmacs
	users who want fontification will have to do:
	(add-hook 'browse-kill-ring-hook 'font-lock-mode)
	* Integrated code from Michael Slass <mikesl@wrq.com> into
	`browse-kill-ring-default-keybindings'.
	* New Japanese homepage for browse-kill-ring.el, thanks to
	Yasutaka SHINDOH <ring-pub@fan.gr.jp>.
	* Correctly restore window configuration after editing an entry.
	* New command `browse-kill-ring-insert-and-delete'.
	* Bug reports and patches from Michael Slass <mikesl@wrq.com> and
	Juanma Barranquero <lektu@terra.es>.

	Changes from 0.9b to 1.0:
	* Add autoload cookie to `browse-kill-ring'; suggestion from
	D. Goel <deego@glue.umd.edu> and Dave Pearson <davep@davep.org>.
	* Add keybinding tip from Michael Slass <mikesl@wrq.com>.

	Changes from 0.9a to 0.9b:
	* Remove extra parenthesis.  Duh.

	Changes from 0.9 to 0.9a:
	* Fix bug making `browse-kill-ring-quit-action' uncustomizable.
	Patch from Henrik Enberg <henrik@enberg.org>.
	* Add `url-link' and `group' attributes to main Customization
	group.

	Changes from 0.8 to 0.9:
	* Add new function `browse-kill-ring-insert-and-quit', bound to 'i'
	by default (idea from Yasutaka Shindoh).
	* Make default `browse-kill-ring-quit-action' be
	`bury-and-delete-window', which handles the case of a single window
	more nicely.
	* Note change of home page and author address.

	Changes from 0.7 to 0.8:
	* Fix silly bug in `browse-kill-ring-edit' which made it impossible
	to edit entries.
	* New variable `browse-kill-ring-quit-action'.
	* `browse-kill-ring-restore' renamed to `browse-kill-ring-quit'.
	* Describe the keymaps in mode documentation.  Patch from
	Marko Slyz <mslyz@eecs.umich.edu>.
	* Fix advice documentation for `browse-kill-ring-no-duplicates'.

	Changes from 0.6 to 0.7:
	* New functions `browse-kill-ring-search-forward' and
	`browse-kill-ring-search-backward', bound to "s" and "r" by
	default, respectively.
	* New function `browse-kill-ring-edit' bound to "e" by default, and
	a associated new major mode.
	* New function `browse-kill-ring-occur', bound to "l" by default.

	Changes from 0.5 to 0.6:
	* Fix bug in `browse-kill-ring-forward' which sometimes would cause
	a message "Wrong type argument: overlayp, nil" to appear.
	* New function `browse-kill-ring-update'.
	* New variable `browse-kill-ring-highlight-current-entry'.
	* New variable `browse-kill-ring-display-duplicates'.
	* New optional advice `browse-kill-ring-no-kill-new-duplicates',
	and associated variable `browse-kill-ring-no-duplicates'.  Code
	from Klaus Berndl <Klaus.Berndl@sdm.de>.
	* Bind "?" to `describe-mode'.  Patch from Dave Pearson
	<dave@davep.org>.
	* Fix typo in `browse-kill-ring-display-style' defcustom form.
	Thanks "Kahlil (Kal) HODGSON" <kahlil@discus.anu.edu.au>.

	Changes from 0.4 to 0.5:
	* New function `browse-kill-ring-delete', bound to "d" by default.
	* New function `browse-kill-ring-undo', bound to "U" by default.
	* New variable `browse-kill-ring-maximum-display-length'.
	* New variable `browse-kill-ring-use-fontification'.
	* New variable `browse-kill-ring-hook', called after the
	"*Kill Ring*" buffer is created.

	Changes from 0.3 to 0.4:
	* New functions `browse-kill-ring-forward' and
	`browse-kill-ring-previous', bound to "n" and "p" by default,
	respectively.
	* Change the default `browse-kill-ring-display-style' to
	`separated'.
	* Removed `browse-kill-ring-original-window-config'; Now
	`browse-kill-ring-restore' just buries the "*Kill Ring*" buffer
	and deletes its window, which is simpler and more intuitive.
	* New variable `browse-kill-ring-separator-face'.
