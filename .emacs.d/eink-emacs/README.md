# Eink color theme for Emacs

Low distraction, minimalistic color theme for Emacs emulating reading
on E Ink devices.

## Example

## Why?

Back in a day, I used to play a lot with color themes. One day I
pair-programmed with coleague of mine and I noticed that he didn't use
syntax highlighting at all. It's been quite a strange experince, but
after a while I decided to give it a try.

Well, long story short, I started to really like it and there was no
way going back. Now I find most of the color themes quite distracting.

Many of these color themes are using shining colors for stuff I don't
care about (e.g. builtin functions), and they try to hide things I
want to see (e.g. useful comments).

## Other packages which I use along with this theme
