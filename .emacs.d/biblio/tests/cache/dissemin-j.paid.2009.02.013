However, two differing conceptualizations of this construct create confusion. This study compared how each operationalization of proactive coping relates to well-being. Participants (N = 281) facing an upcoming college examination completed the Proactive Coping Inventory (PCI; consisting of two subscales that each assess one of the conceptualizations), the Proactive Competence Scale (PCS; that assesses the proactive coping process), and measures of well-being. The results demonstrated that conceptualizing proactive coping as a positively-focused striving for goals was predictive of well-being (the shared variance from affect, subjective well-being and physical symptoms), whereas conceptualizing proactive coping as focused on preventing a negative future was not. The first conceptualization of proactive coping\u2019s unique association with well-being was explained by two of the proactive competencies, use of resources and realistic goal setting, and the remaining variance in well-being was explained by the first factor of optimism. These results demonstrated that aspiring for a positive future is distinctly predictive of well-being and that research should focus on accumulating resources and goal setting in designing interventions to promote proactive coping.", "pdf_url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2705166", "source": "base", "keywords": "Article", "identifier": "ftpubmed:oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:2705166", "type": ""}], "publications": [{"publisher": "Elsevier BV", "doi": "10.1016/j.paid.2009.02.013", "issue": "2", "journal": "Personality and Individual Differences", "issn": "0191-8869", "volume": "47", "policy": {"romeo_id": "30", "preprint": "can", "postprint": "can", "published": "cannot"}, "type": "journal-article", "pages": "139-144"}], "authors": [{"name": {"last": "Sohl", "first": "Stephanie Jean"}}, {"name": {"last": "Moyer", "first": "Anne"}}], "date": "2009-07-01", "type": "journal-article"}}
