;;; Commentary:

;; Purpose:
;;
;;  Mark and find your favorite org-locations and other points of interest
;;  easily; create and update a lookup table of references and links. When
;;  searching, frequently used entries appear at the the top and entering
;;  some keywords narrows down to matching entries only, so that the
;;  right one can be spotted easily.
;;
;;  References are essentially small numbers (e.g. "R237" or "-455-"),
;;  which are created by this package; they are well suited to be used
;;  outside org. Links are normal org-mode links.
;;
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;  - Add these lines to your .emacs:
;;
;;    ;; use the real path from your org-installation
;;    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/contrib/lisp" t) 
;;    (require 'org-index)
;;
;;  - Restart your emacs to make these lines effective
;;
;;  - Invoke `org-index', which will assist in creating your index
;;    table. The variable org-index-id will be persisted within your
;;    customization file (typically .emacs).
;;
;;
;; Further reading:
;;
;;  See the documentation of `org-index', which can also be read
;;  by invoking `org-index' and and choosing the help-command.
;;
;;  For more documentation and working examples, see:

  "Mark and find your favorite things and org-locations easily:
Create and update a lookup table of references and links. Often
used entries bubble to the top; entering some keywords narrows
down to matching entries only, so that the right one can be
spotted easily.

References are essentially small numbers (e.g. \"R237\" or \"-455-\"),
which are created by this package; they are well suited to be used
outside of org. Links are normal org-mode links.

This is version 2.4.3 of org-index.

The function `org-index' operates on a dedicated table, the index
table, which lives within its own Org-mode node. The table and
its node will be created, when you first invoke org-index.

Each line in the index table contains:

 - A reference (e.g. \"R237\")

 - An optional link to another location in org

 - A number, counting, how often each reference has been
   used. This number is updated automatically and the table can
   be sorted after it, so that most frequently used references
   appear at the top of the table and can be spotted easily.

 - The creation date of the line

 - Date and time of last access. This column can alternatively be
   used to sort the table.

 - A column for your own comments

The index table is found through the id of the containing
node; this id is stored within the variable `org-index-id'.


The function `org-index' is the only interactive function of this
package and its main entry point; it offers several commands to
create, find and look up line within the index table.

Commands known:

  occur: Incremental search, that shows matching lines from the
    index table, updated after every keystroke. You may enter a
    list of words seperated by space or comma (\",\"), to select
    lines that contain all of the given words.

    You may also read the note at the end of this help on saving
    the keystroke RET with this frequent default command.

  head: If invoked outside the index table, ask for a reference
    number and search for an entry, which either has this
    reference contained in its heading or within its property
    org-index-ref. If invoked from within the index table dont
    ask; rather use the reference or link from the current line.

  ref: Create a new reference, copy any previously selected text.
    If already within index table, fill in ref-column.

  link: Create a new line in index table with a link to the
    current node.  Do not populate the ref column; this can later
    be populated by calling the \"fill\" command from within the
    index table.

  leave: Leave the index table. If the last command has been
    \"ref\", the new reference is copied and ready to yank.  This
    \"org-mark-ring-goto\" and can be called several times in
    succession. If you invoke org-index with a prefix argument,
    this command \"leave\" is executed without further questions.

  put: Put the reference, that was created last, as the value of
    property org-index-ref into the current node. That way it can
    be found by a later call to \"head\". 

  enter: Just enter the node with the index table.

  goto: Enter index table and go to a specific reference.

  help: Show this text.

  +: Show all commands including the less frequently used ones
    given below. If \"+\" is followd by enough letters of such a
    command (e.g. \"+fi\"), then this command (e.g. \"fill\") is
    invoked directly.

  reorder: Temporarily reorder the index table, e.g. by count,
    reference or last access.

  fill: If either ref or link is missing in current line of index
    table, fill in the missing value.

  sort: Sort a set of lines (either from the active region or the
    whole buffer) by references found in each line.

  update: For the given reference, update the line in the
    index table, i.e. increment its count.

  multi-occur: Apply emacs standard multi-occur operation on all
    org-mode buffers to search for the given reference.

  highlight: Highlight references in active region or buffer.

  unhighlight: Remove those highlights.

  missing : Search for missing reference numbers (which do not
    appear in the reference table). If requested, add additional
    lines for them, so that the command \"ref\" is able to reuse
    them.

  statistics : Show some statistics (e.g. minimum and maximum
    reference) about index table.



Two ways to save keystrokes:

When prompting for a command, org-index puts the most likely
one (e.g. \"occur\" or \"ref\") in front of the list, so that
you may just type RET.

If this first command in the list of commands needs additional
input (like e.g. \"occur\"), you may supply this input right
away, although you are still beeing prompted for the command. So,
to do an occur for the string \"foo\", you can just enter \"foo\"
RET, without even typing \"occur\".


Another way to save keystrokes applies if you want to choose a
command, that requrires a reference number and would normally
prompt for it: In that case you may just enter enough characters
from your command, so that it appears first in the list of
matches; then immediately enter the number of the reference you
are searching for. So the input \"h237\" would execute the
command \"head\" for reference \"237\".

  Detailed explanation:


  The index table above has three lines of headings above the first
  hline:

  - The first one is ignored by org-index, and you can use it to
    give meaningful names to columns. In the table above only one
    column has a name (\"comment\"). This line is optional.

  - The second line is the most important one, because it
    contains the configuration information for org-index; please
    read further below for its format.

  - The third line is again optional; it may only specify the
    widths of the individual columns (e.g. <4>).

  The columns get their meaning by the second line of headings;
  specifically by one of the keywords (e.g. \"ref\") or a flag
  seperated by a semicolon (e.g. \";s\").



  The keywords and flags are:


  - ref: This contains the reference, which consists of a decorated
    number, which is incremented for each new line. References are
    meant to be used in org-mode headlines or outside of org,
    e.g. within folder names.

  - link: org-mode link pointing to the matching location within org.

  - first: When has this line been first accessed (i.e. created) ?

  - count: How many times has this line been accessed ? The
    trailing flag \"s\" makes the table beeing sorted after this
    column this column, so that often used entries appear at the
    top of the table.

  - last: When has this line been accessed last ?

  - The last column above has no keyword, only the flag \"c\",
    which makes its content beeing copied under certain
    conditions. It is typically used for comments.

  The sequence of columns does not matter. You may reorder them any
  way you like. Columns are found by their name, which appears in
  the second line of headings.

  You can add further columns or even remove the last column. All
  other columns are required.

  Finally: This node needs not be a top level node; its name is
  completely at you choice; it is found through its ID only.
