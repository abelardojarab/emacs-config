# This file is used for SCSS + Compass.
# You can write SCSS then compile to CSS with this file.

# Usage guide:
# Install ruby-devel first
# sudo gem update --system
# sudo gem install scss
# sudo gem install compass
# cd org-ioslide
# compass2.0 watch -s expanded

# Require any additional compass plugins here.

# Set this to the root of your project when deployed:
http_path = "/"
css_dir = "theme/css"
sass_dir = "theme/scss"
images_dir = "images"
javascripts_dir = "js"

# You can select your preferred output style here (can be overridden via the command line):
output_style = :compressed #:expanded or :nested or :compact or :compressed

# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:
# relative_assets = true

# To disable debugging comments that display the original location of your selectors. Uncomment:
# line_comments = false


# If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this
# project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:
# preferred_syntax = :sass
# and then run:
# sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass sass scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass
