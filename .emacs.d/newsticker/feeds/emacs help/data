For Elisp, I additionally use:

you use `C-x C-f' and then hit `C-down' you will visit the next file.
Holding down Control and repeating `down' visits successive files, in

Did you set the hooks?

In my .emacs I find e.g.

,-------------------------------------------------------------
| (add-hook 'outline-minor-mode-hook 'outshine-hook-function))
| (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'outline-minor-mode)
| (add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'outline-minor-mode))
`-------------------------------------------------------------

so whenever outline-minor-mode is activated, the
`outshine-hook-function' is called for setting up things. For
emacs-lisp-mode and message-mode (and others not listed) I then activate
outline-minor-mode by default.

Dired has some very nice shortcuts for this sort of thing: If you hit
\"v\" on a file, you'll visit it in view mode, which means you can hit \"q\"
to close it. So looking quickly though a bunch of text files just means
bouncing between \"n\", \"v\" and \"q\". I think view mode is great.
Also check \"o\" and \"C-o\" -- the latter might be all you need. Other than
that, it wouldn't be too hard to write something like a \"follow mode\"
for dired. If it closed the files afterwards that would be nice.

how can I (directly) achieve this behaviour in non-batch mode?

There's no stdin, because that's where the keys you're typing
interactively are coming from, normally.
Now, on linux, the program could use /dev/tty for interactive terminal
I/O instead of /dev/stdin, so you could both read a stdin file and have
terminal interaction.  But this is specific to linux (AFAIK).
Of course, with X, the keys come from the the X server instead of the
terminal, so again, stdin would be free for an input stream.
But this would require a special case, compared to running emacs in a
terminal on a non linux system.  I guess you will have to patch emacs to
get it.
