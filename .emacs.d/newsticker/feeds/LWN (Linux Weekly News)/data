      Power-aware scheduling attempts to place processes on CPUs in a way that
minimizes the system's overall consumption of power.  Discussion in this
area has been muted since we <a href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/554956/\">last looked at
it</a> in 
June, but work has been proceeding.  Now a new set of power-aware
scheduling patches shows a significant change in direction motivated by
criticisms that were aired in June.  This particular problem is far from
solved, but the shape of the eventual solution may be becoming a bit more
clear.
