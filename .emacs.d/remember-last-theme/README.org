* Remember Last Theme(s)

  This package makes possible that when you quit Emacs, the current
 theme(s) settings will be stored as if they had been set using
 =customize-themes=, and restored back in the next session when your
 =custom-file= is loaded.

** Installation
   
*** Using Emacs' built-in customization

    *NOTICE* make sure your =custom-file= is loaded when you start
    Emacs, otherwise the saved theme(s) won't activate.

**** Manual

    Download =remember-last-theme.el= to some place in your emacs' load
    path and add the following to your emacs' initialization file:
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (require 'remember-last-theme)
     (remember-last-theme-enable)
   #+END_SRC

**** With =use-package=

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (use-package remember-last-theme
       :ensure t
       :config (remember-last-theme-enable))
   #+END_SRC

*** Using an external file

    You can also use an external file for saving the theme
    settings. This is particular useful if from time to time you
    declare =custom-file= bankruptcy due to the file getting
    inconsistent. 

**** Manual

    Download =remember-last-theme.el= to some place in your emacs' load
    path and add the following to your emacs' initialization file:
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (require 'remember-last-theme)
     (remember-last-theme-with-file-enable "path to file")
   #+END_SRC

**** With =use-package=

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (use-package remember-last-theme
       :ensure t
       :config (remember-last-theme-with-file-enable "path to file"))
   #+END_SRC
