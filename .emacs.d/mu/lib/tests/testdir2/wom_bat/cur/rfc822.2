Saw the website. Am willing to stipulate that you are not RIST 9E03. Suspect
that you are the Dentist, who yearns for honest exchange of views. Anonymous,
digitally signed e-mail is the only safe vehicle for same.

If you want me to believe you are not the Dentist, provide plausible
explanation for your question regarding why we are building the Crypt.

Yours truly,

As I stepped on this unknown middle-aged Filipina's feet during an ill-advised
ballroom dancing foray, she leaned close to me and uttered some latitude and
longitude figures with a conspicuously large number of significant digits of
precision, implying a maximum positional error on the order of the size of a
dinner plate. Gosh, was I ever curious!
