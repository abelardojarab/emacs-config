The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock
has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pomegue, and
approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and
sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil,
asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board. However, those
experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was
not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being
skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off,
and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the
narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and
vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of
the pilot.
