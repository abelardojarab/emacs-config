* 0.10.0 (June 11th, 2016)

** Changes and New Features

*** Yasnippet now prints far fewer message by default.
See Github #682, #683.

*** `yas-wrap-around-region' can be set to a register.
The register's content will be used.  This is like the old `cua'
option, but can be used with any register and doesn't require enabling
cua-mode.

*** Clearing of snippet fields is now decided by the command's effect.
The `delete-selection' property is no longer consulted.  See Github #662.

*** Empty lines in snippet expansion are no longer indented.
See Github #679.

*** All lines from mirror output are now indented.
See Github #665.

*** New variable yas-alias-to-yas/prefix-p
See Github #696, #699.

*** New function yas-next-field-will-exit-p
See Github #561.

*** `snippet-mode' is now autoloaded.

** Fixed Bugs

*** Fix incompatibility with Emacs 25 and haskell-mode.
This should also help other modes with a non-nil syntax-propertize
function.  See Github #687.

*** Text property changes no longer disable snippets.
This prevents cc-mode based modes from causing premature exit of
snippets.  See Github #677.

*** Fields are now transformed correctly after `yas-next-field'.
See Github #381.

*** The $> construct is now escaped correctly, and documented.
See Github #640.

*** Avoid corruption of snippet content when loading from files.
See Github #707 and Emacs bug #23659.

*** `yas-wrap-around-region' now works for snippets with fields
farther down the buffer than $0.  See Github #636.

*** The active region is deleted when using `yas-expand'.
This makes it consistent with `yas-insert-snippet'.  See Github #523.

*** Fix mirror+autofill interaction.
See Github #643 and http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/19206/5296.

*** Snippet insertion no longer adds irrelevant strings to kill ring.
See Github #675.


* 0.9.1 (April 3rd, 2016)

** Changes and New Features

*** Noam Postavsky is now the official yasnippet maintainer.

*** `yas-visit-snippet-file' now works for compiled snippets (see Github #597).

*** New function `yas-lookup-snippet' (see Github #595, #596).

*** .emacs.d/snippets directory is now created automatically.
If that value is present in `yas-snippet-dirs' (see Github #648).

*** Default value for `yas-snippet-dirs' now uses `user-emacs-directory'
instead of hardcoding "~/emacs.d" (see Github #632).

*** `yas-visit-snippet-file' no longer overrides `yas-prompt-functions',
see Github #576.

*** The defaults for prompting have changed.
`yas-x-prompt' is no longer present in the default value of
`yas-prompt-functions'.

The new function `yas-maybe-ido-prompt' (which performs ido prompting
if `ido-mode' is enabled) replaces `yas-ido-prompt' (which always
performs ido prompting).  Previously the behaviour was dependent on
the Emacs version being used.

*** The default value of `yas-buffer-local-condition' now works for `yas-insert-snippet' too.
See Github #305.

*** The default value of `yas-new-snippet-default' no longer inserts `require-final-newline: nil'.
It was redundant, since `mode: snippet' already accomplishes the same.
`binding: ${4:direct-keybinding}}' is also removed, as it is hardly
ever wanted.

*** Snippet fields are only cleared by commands with `delete-selection' property,
See Github #515, #644.

*** `yas-initialize' (and backward compat alias `yas/initialize') are restored,
but marked obsolete, use (yas-global-mode +1) instead.  See Github
#546, #569.

*** `yas-key-syntaxes' is much more powerful and accepts functions.
Enables use cases when discovering keys based on buffer syntax is not
good enough.  See issue #497.

*** Documentation rewritten in org-mode and updated.
A tremendous effort by Noam Postavsky.  Hopefully easier to maintain
and navigate.  Available at <http://capitaomorte.github.io/yasnippet>.

*** Snippets are now maintained in their own repo.
Snippets live in Andrea Crotti's
<https://github.com/andreacrotti/yasnippet-snippets>.  See README.md
for more details.

*** Textmate snippet importer moved to separate `yasmate' repo.
URL is <https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasmate>.  See README.md for
more details.

*** `yas-snippet-dirs' now allows symbols as aliases to directories.
The added level of indirection should allow more esoteric
configurations (see Github #495).

*** `yas-reload-all' can now jit-load when called interactively.

*** New `yas-after-reload-hook' run after `yas-reload-all'.
See <https://github.com/pezra/rspec-mode/pull/75> for the discussion
leading up to this change.

*** New functions `yas-activate-extra-mode' and `yas-deactivate-extra-mode'.
These are preferable to setting `yas-extra-modes' directly in the mode
hook (see issue #420 for more information).

*** New variable `yas-new-snippet-default'.
The default snippet suggested on `yas-new-snippet' can now be
customized.

** Fixed bugs

*** `yas-expand' now sets `this-command' when falling back to another command.
Previously it was setting `this-original-command', which does not
match the documented semantics.  See Github #587.

*** Github #537: Be lenient to extensions operating on snippet fields.

*** Github #619: Parents of extra modes are now activated too.

*** Github #549: `yas-verbosity' is now applied to `load' calls too.

*** Github #607; avoid obscure Emacs bug triggered by overlays in *Messages* buffer.
It was triggered by yasnippet+flycheck+highlight-parentheses.  See
also <http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=21824>

*** Github #617; fix x prompt when snippet inserts many lines.

*** Github #618; avoid breakage if `scan-sexp' modifies match data.
Which it does in Emacs 25.

*** Github #562: Deleting inner numberless snippet caused an error.

*** Github #418, #536: Fix navigation to zero-length fields at snippet end.

*** Github #527, #525 and #526: Attempt to prevent "fallback loops"
when interactiing with other extensions that use similar fallback
mechanisms.


* 0.8.0 (August 2012)

** Changes and New Features

*** All YASnippet symbols now prefixed with `yas-'.  Keep old `yas/' versions as aliases.

*** Yasnippet is now Free Software Foundation's copyright.

*** `yas-dont-activate' can be a list of functions.

*** Snippets are loaded just-in-time .
Thanks to Matthew Fidler for a lot of input with the implementation.

*** yasnippet-bundle.el is no longer available.
Use `yas-compile-directory' instead if you need the speed advantage.

*** New functions `yas-compile-directory' and `yas-recompile-all'.
This feature is still undocumented.  Generate a
.yas-compiled-snippets.el file in the directory passed where snippets
are compiled into emacs-lisp code.

*** New `yas-verbosity' variable.

*** Interactively calling `yas-exit-snippet' exits most recently inserted snippet.

*** Using filenames as snippet triggers is deprecated.

*** Default value of `yas-show-menu-p' is `abbreviate'.

*** `yas-visit-snippet' ignores `yas-prompt-functions'.

*** `yas-buffer-local-condition' restricted to trigger-key expansions by default.

*** `yas-load-snippet-buffer' (`C-c C-c') in `snippet-mode' has been much improved.

*** New variable `yas-expand-only-for-last-commands', thanks Erik Postma.

*** New variable `yas-extra-modes' aliases old `yas/mode-symbol'.

*** New `yas-describe-tables' command.

*** New `yas-define-condition-cache' macro.
This defines an optimised function for placing in a `# condition:'
directive that will run at most once per snippet-expansion attempt.

*** Mirrors can occur inside fields.

*** New `# type: command' directive.
This feature is still largely undocumented.

*** A hidden .yas-setup.el is loaded if found in a snippet directory.

*** `yas-wrap-around-region' can now also be `cua' (undocumented feature).

*** Make menu groups automatically using new .yas-make-groups file.

*** Per-snippet keybindings using `# keybinding:' directive.

*** More friendly `yas-expand-snippet' calling convention.
This breaks backward compatibility.

*** The `# env:' directive is now `# expand-env:'.

*** Setup multiple parent modes using new .yas-parents file.

** Fixed bugs

*** Github #281: jit-load snippets in the correct order.

*** Github #245: primary field transformations work inside nested fields.

*** Github #242: stop using the deprecated `assoc' library.

*** Github #233: show direct snippet keybindings in the menu.

*** Github #194, Googlecode 192: Compatibility with `fci-mode'.

*** Github #147, Googlecode 145: Snippets comments were getting inserted.

*** Github #141, Googlecode 139: searching buffer in embedded elisp works slightly better.
Issue is still open for analysis, though

*** Github #95, Googlecode 193: no more stack overflow in org-mode.
