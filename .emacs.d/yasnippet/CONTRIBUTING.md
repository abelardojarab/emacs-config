## Copyright Assignment

Yasnippet is part of GNU ELPA, so it falls under the same copyright
assignment policy as the rest of Emacs (see "Copyright Assignment" in
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/CONTRIBUTE). A copyright assignment
for Emacs also covers Yasnippet.

## Commit message format

The commit message format roughly follows Emacs conventions, although
there is no separate Changelog file.

    The commit message's first sentence should be capitalized, no period

    It may be followed by a paragraph with a longer explanation. The
    changelog style entry goes at the end of the message.

    * foo.el (a-function): Terse summary of per-function changes.

For trivial changes, a message consisting of just the changelog entry
(the `* foo.el ...` part) is fine.
