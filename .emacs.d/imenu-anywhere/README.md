# imenu-anywhere

`imenu-anywhere` provides navigation for imenu tags across all buffers that
satisfy a filtering criteria. Available criteria are - all buffers with the same
major mode, same project buffers and user defined list of friendly mode buffers.

## Installation

Available from `package.el` community maintained repos -
[MELPA Stable][] and [MELPA][] repos.

Install using the following command:

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] imenu-anywhere [RET]</kbd>

or if you'd rather keep it in your dotfiles:

```el
(unless (package-installed-p 'imenu-anywhere)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'imenu-anywhere))
```

If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

<kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>

## Usage

Simply bind `imenu-anywhere` to a key of your choice:

```el
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-.") #'imenu-anywhere)
```

By default `imenu-anywhere` uses `completing-read` for completion. If you are
using `ido-ubiquitous` or `helm-mode` which redefine `completing-read-function`
you are set. Otherwise you can use any of the provided wrappers directly:

  - `ido-imenu-anywhere`,
  - `ivy-imenu-anywhere` or
  - `helm-imenu-anywhere`

For the last two wrappers you will need to install `ivy` or `helm` separately.

## Configuration

By default `imenu-anywhere` makes tags available from buffers with the same
mode, same project and friendly modes defined by `imenu-anywhere-friendly-modes`. 
You can configure the filtering strategies with `imenu-anywhere-buffer-filter-functions`.
