;; An enhanced scrolling experience when quickly navigating through a buffer
;; with fast scrolling (usually via key-repeat instead of manual scrolling).

;; This is more for internal use only to resolve timing issues with
;; flip-flopping between buffers quickly.
;; Initial idea was a single store to restore settings on, but that
;; could end up "locking" a buffer if for some reason end fails to run
;; for some odd reason.
;; If the user does aggressively switch buffers and scroll fast in them,
;; the worst case is prevented (all buffers become un-fast after the timer).
;; However, no attempt is going to be made to 'fast-scroll' every buffer in this way,
;; because all the timing sensitive code is a global package variable.
