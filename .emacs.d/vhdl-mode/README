Installation:	Instructions are included in the INSTALL file.

Documentation:	An online documentation is included in VHDL Mode which can
		be displayed within Emacs by typing C-c C-h (or by selecting
		the VHDL menu entry).
		Documentation on the indentation engine can be found in the
		file `vhdl-mode.info'.

Customization:	Perform customization of VHDL Mode within Emacs using the
		`Customize' VHDL menu entry. Do NOT set any VHDL Mode variables
		using the `vhdl-mode-hook' in .emacs anymore (except for
		customization of the indentation engine, as described in
		`vhdl-mode.info'). For site-wide customization, read the 
		instructions in the INSTALL file.

Release Notes:	Please consult the release notes for new features and important
		changes in the current release.  They are accessible within
