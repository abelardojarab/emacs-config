Professional Theme
==================

This is a port of Vim's Professional Theme for Emacs, originally created by
Narayanan Iyer. It doesn't try to be 100% faithful, I've modified several faces to
my liking.

This is a light background theme that doesn't go over the top with the
highlightings, but it is also NOT a superlow contrast theme like Solarized which
cause my eyes to tire a lot more (I must be rare).

It looks decent enough on terminal Emacs.

This is published on the MELPA repository so if you have it there is no need
to add it manually.
