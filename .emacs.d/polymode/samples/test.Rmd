# Evaluate and echo different lines
 
For demonstration purposes, we may want to show some source code in the output,
but really evaluate different code in the background.

```{r}
hook_source <- knit_hooks$get('source')
knit_hooks$set(source = function(x, options) {
    res <- hook_source(x, options)
    gsub("(^|\n)#'#' ", '\\1', res)
})
```

The trick is to mask the source code in special comments (e.g. `#'#'`), and
remove the comment markers later. Of course, you have to guarantee these markers
are unique.

```{r test, echo=-3}
x <- 2
## 1/sqrt(2 * pi) * exp(-x^2/2)
dnorm(x)
```    


We used `echo=-3` to remove the 3rd expression from the source code, and
`gsub()` to strip `#'#'` off.

This is completely hack. Use with care.
