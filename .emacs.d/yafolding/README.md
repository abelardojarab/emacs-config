## Config Example

### Default Keymap

```emacs-lisp
(defvar yafolding-mode-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map (kbd "<C-S-return>") #'yafolding-hide-parent-element)
    (define-key map (kbd "<C-M-return>") #'yafolding-toggle-all)
    (define-key map (kbd "<C-return>") #'yafolding-toggle-element)
    map))
```

### Discover commands with a context menu

Call `M-x yafolding-discover` to have a magit-like context menu that
displays the available commands. This feature relies on
[discover.el](https://www.github.com/mickeynp/discover.el).

To give it a keybinding:

    (global-set-key (kbd "s-d y") 'yafolding-discover)

### Hook into prog-mode-hook

```emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook
          (lambda () (yafolding-mode)))
```

### Modify keybindings

```
(require 'yafolding)
(define-key yafolding-mode-map (kbd "<C-S-return>") nil)
(define-key yafolding-mode-map (kbd "<C-M-return>") nil)
(define-key yafolding-mode-map (kbd "<C-return>") nil)
(define-key yafolding-mode-map (kbd "C-c <C-M-return>") 'yafolding-toggle-all)
(define-key yafolding-mode-map (kbd "C-c <C-S-return>") 'yafolding-hide-parent-element)
(define-key yafolding-mode-map (kbd "C-c <C-return>") 'yafolding-toggle-element)
```

## Known Issue

### data loss on delete-trailing-whitespace

use this instated:

```emacs-lisp
(lambda ()
    (yafolding-show-all)
    (delete-trailing-whitespace))
```
