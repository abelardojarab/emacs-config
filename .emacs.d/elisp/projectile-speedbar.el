;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package sits on top of speedbar and projectile and provides an
;; easy to use and useful integration between the two.
;;
;; With this package when you switch between projects that work with
;; projectile, speedbar will automatically show the directly listing
;; of that project as well as expand the tree to show the file in the
;; project.
;;
;; To invoke this function manually:
;;
;; `nv-speedbar-open-current-buffer-in-tree
;;

;;; Installation
;;
;; Copy speedbar-projectile.el to your load-path and add this to ~/.emacs
;;
;;  (require 'projectile-emacs)
;;
;; Sometimes, when I am deep in a project tree, I like to use this shortcut
;; to see full context:
;;
;;  (global-set-key (kbd "M-<f2>") 'nv-speedbar-open-current-buffer-in-tree)
;;

;;; Customize:

;; * 13 June 2014
