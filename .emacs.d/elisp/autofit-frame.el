;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Automatically resize one-window frames to fit.
;;
;;  Functions are provided here to automatically resize each frame to
;;  fit its selected window, when there is no other window in the
;;  frame.  Some standard Emacs primitive functions are redefined to
;;  do this: `display-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only),
;;  `switch-to-buffer', and `pop-to-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only).
;;
;;  Prior to Emacs 23, automatic frame resizing is also provided here
;;  implicitly for functions `switch-to-buffer-other-window' and
;;  `switch-to-buffer-other-frame', since they ultimately use
;;  `display-buffer', and so the version of it defined here.  (Command
;;  `switch-to-buffer' does not use `display-buffer' - it is redefined
;;  separately here, for all Emacs versions.)
;;
;;  Put the following in your Emacs initialization file (`~/.emacs'),
;;  in order to provide for automatic frame resizing:
;;
;;    (require 'autofit-frame)
;;    (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'fit-frame)
;;
;;  The second line here causes newly created frames to be fitted to
;;  their buffer (window).  Even if you load `auto-fit-frames.el', you
;;  will still need to do this, because `display-buffer' and so on are
;;  not called when a new frame is created.
;;
;;  To automatically fit frames that show a temporary buffer in their
;;  sole window, add this to your initialization file also:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'temp-buffer-show-hook                ; Emacs < 24.4
;;              'fit-frame-if-one-window 'append)
;;
;;    (add-hook 'temp-buffer-window-show-hook         ; Emacs 24.4+
;;              'fit-frame-if-one-window 'append)
;;
;;  User option (variable) `autofit-frames-flag' turns on and off the
;;  automatic resizing defined here.  Setting it to nil turns it off:
;;  (setq autofit-frames-flag nil).  You can also bind it to nil to
;;  temporarily inhibit frame resizing in Lisp code:
;;
;;         (let ((autofit-frames-flag nil))...)
;;
;;
;;  New user option (variable) defined here: `autofit-frames-flag'.
;;
;;  New function defined here (useful as a `temp-buffer-show-hook'):
;;
;;    `fit-frame-if-one-window'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following function defined in `window.el' has been
;;              REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `window--display-buffer-1' (Emacs 23+) -
;;     Resize frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following EMACS PRIMITIVES are REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `display-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only) -
;;     1) Use `read-buffer' in interactive spec.
;;     2) Resize frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'
;;        (and provided buffer was not yet displayed).
;;     3) Raise the frame.
;;     4) Restore point in buffer - fixes unknown Emacs 22 bug.
;;
;;  `pop-to-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only) -
;;     Use the `display-buffer' defined here.
;;
;;  `switch-to-buffer' (all Emacs versions) -
;;     1) Use `read-buffer' in interactive spec.
;;     2) If current window is dedicated, then use another window.
;;     3) Resize frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'
;;        (unless BUFFER is already the `current-buffer').
;;
;;
;;  This file loads file `fit-frame.el', which provides the main
;;  functionality behind the automatic frame resizing.  See it for
;;  user options to do such things as customize default frame sizes.
;;
;;  The reason for separating the code here from that in
;;  `fit-frame.el' is to let you load that code but not load the code
;;  here, if you do not want to redefine Emacs primitives.
;;
;;  This file was formerly called `shrink-fit-all.el', then
;;  `auto-resize-frames.el'.
;;
;;
;;  See also these files for other frame commands:
;;
;;     `doremi-frm.el'    - Incrementally adjust frame properties
;;                          using arrow keys and/or mouse wheel.
;;
;;     `frame-cmds.el'    - Miscellaneous frame and window commands.
;;
;;     `thumb-frm.el'     - Shrink frames to a thumbnail size and
;;                          restore them again.
;;
;;     `zoom-frm.el'      - Zoom a frame, so that its font becomes
;;                          larger or smaller.
