;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Let DEL delete the region; let character insertion replace it.
;;
;;  Makes the active region be pending a deletion, meaning that text
;;  inserted while the region is active will replace the region
;;  contents, and that operations like `delete-backward-char' will
;;  delete the region.
;;
;;  `C-g' is bound here to `minibuffer-keyboard-quit' in each of the
;;  minibuffer-local-*-map's.
;;
;;
;;  Property `delete-selection':
;;
;;  Commands that delete the selection need a `delete-selection'
;;  property on their symbols. Commands that insert text but do not
;;  have this property do not delete the selection.  The property can
;;  be one of these values:

;;  `yank' - For commands that do a yank. Ensures that the region
;;           about to be deleted is not yanked.

;;  `supersede' - Delete the active region and ignore the current command:
;;           the command just deletes the region.
;;
;;  `kill' - `kill-region' is used on the selection, rather than
;;           `delete-region'.  Text selected with the mouse is
;;           typically yankable anyway.
;;
;;  anything else non-nil - Deletes the active region prior to
;;           executing the command, which inserts replacement
;;           text. This is the usual case.
;;
;;
;; The original author is Matthieu Devin <devin@lucid.com>.
;; This version was modified by Drew Adams.
;;
;; Main changes here from the original:
;; -----------------------------------
;;
;; 1. Added function `delete-selection-pre-hook-1'.  In fact,
;;    `delete-selection-pre-hook' was renamed to
;;    `delete-selection-pre-hook-1', and a new version of
;;    `delete-selection-pre-hook' was defined in terms of it.
;;    This allowed change #2 (next).
;; 2. Fixed bug: `completion.el' was making things like SPC and `.'
;;    lose on self insert here.
;; 3. Will now work in tandem with `completion.el':
;;    a. `delete-active-region': Deletes latest completion only.
;;       During completion, don't delete region when self-insert.
;;    b. `delete-selection-pre-hook': In case of completion, makes
;;       mark active.
;; 4. `minibuffer-keyboard-quit':
;;    Removes any windows showing *Completions* buffer.
;; 5. `delete-selection-mode': Informs user of new state.
;;
;; You might want to do something like the following in your .emacs:
;;
;;       (make-variable-buffer-local 'transient-mark-mode)
;;       (put 'transient-mark-mode 'permanent-local t)
;;       (setq-default transient-mark-mode t)

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2011/01/03 dadams
;;     Added autoload cookie for command.
;; 2009/10/02 dadams
;;     minibuffer-keyboard-quit:
;;       Don't call delete-windows-on if no buffer.  Thx to Tetzlaff.
;; 2008/05/03 dadams
;;     delete-selection-pre-hook: defun, not defsubst.
;; 2007/09/04 dadams
;;     minibuffer-keyboard-quit: remove-windows-on -> delete-windows-on.
;;     Removed require of frame-cmds.el.
;; 2006/03/31 dadams
;;     No longer use display-in-minibuffer.
;; 2005/12/18 dadams
;;     Use minibuffer-prompt face.  Removed require of def-face-const.el.
;; 2005/12/03 dadams
;;     Removed require (soft) of completion.el.
;; 2004/11/12 dadams
;;     Changed so will work with either byte-compiler: Emacs 20 or 21.
;; 2004/09/21 dadams
;;     Updated to work with Emacs 21 (as well as Emacs 20).
;;     Must byte-compile each version separately, however.
;; 2004/08/09 dadams
;;     Some cleanup to agree more with Emacs 20 standard version.
;; 2001/01/10 dadams
;;     Protected remove-windows-on via fboundp.
;; 1999/03/17 dadams
;;     1. Updated to incorporate Emacs 34.1 version.
;;     2. Protected calls with test fboundp.
;; 1996/02/15 dadams
;;     delete-active-region: During completion, don't delete region
;;       when self-insert.
;; 1995/12/28 dadams
;;     Will now work in tandem with completion.el:
;;       delete-active-region: Deletes latest completion only.
;;       delete-selection-pre-hook: In case of completion, makes mark active.
;;       Added delete-selection-pre-hook.
;; 1995/12/08 dadams
;;     completion.el was making things like SPC and `.' lose on self insert here.
;;     (put 'completion-separator-self-insert-command 'delete-selection t)
