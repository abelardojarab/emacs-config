;;; Commentary:

;; Many modern editors and IDEs can graphically indicate the location of the
;; fill column by drawing a thin line (in design parlance, a `rule') down the
;; length of the editing window.  Fill-column-indicator implements this
;; facility in Emacs.

;; Installation and Usage
;; ======================

;; Put this file in your load path and put
;;
;;   (require 'fill-column-indicator)
;;
;; in your .emacs.

;; To toggle graphical indication of the fill column in a buffer, use the
;; command `fci-mode'.

;; Configuration
;; =============

;; On graphical displays the fill-column rule is drawn using a bitmap
;; image.  Its color is controlled by the variable `fci-rule-color', whose
;; value can be any valid color name.  The rule's width in pixels is
;; determined by the variable `fci-rule-width'; the default value is 2.

;; The image formats fci-mode can use are XPM, PBM, and XBM.  If Emacs has
;; been compiled with the appropriate library it uses XPM images by default;
;; if not it uses PBM images, which are natively supported.  You can specify
;; a particular format by setting `fci-rule-image-format' to either xpm,
;; xpm, or xbm.

;; On character terminals the rule is drawn using the character specified by
;; `fci-rule-character'; the default is `|' (ascii 124).  If
;; `fci-rule-character-color' is nil, then it is drawn using fci-rule-color
;; (or the closest approximation thereto that the terminal is capable of); if
;; it is a color name, then that color is used instead.

;; If you'd like the rule to be drawn using fci-rule-character even on
;; graphical displays, set `fci-always-use-textual-rule' to a non-nil value.

;; These variables (as well as those in the next section) can be given
;; buffer-local bindings.

;; Other Options
;; =============

;; When `truncate-lines' is nil, the effect of drawing a fill-column rule is
;; very odd looking. Indeed, it makes little sense to use a rule to indicate
;; the position of the fill column in that case (the positions at which the
;; fill column falls in the visual display space won't in general be
;; collinear).  For this reason, fci-mode sets truncate-lines to t in buffers
;; in which it is enabled and restores it to its previous value when
;; disabled.  You can turn this feature off by setting
;; `fci-handle-truncate-lines' to nil.

;; If `line-move-visual' is t, then vertical navigation can behave oddly in
;; several edge cases while fci-mode is enabled (this is due to a bug in C
;; code).  Accordingly, fci-mode sets line-move-visual to nil in buffers in
;; which it is enabled and restores it to its previous value when
;; disabled.  This can be suppressed by setting `fci-handle-line-move-visual'
;; to nil.  (But you shouldn't want to do this.  There's no reason to use
;; line-move-visual if truncate-lines is t, and it doesn't make sense to use
;; something like fci-mode when truncate-lines is nil.)

;; Fci-mode needs free use of two characters (specifically, it needs the use
;; of two characters whose display table entries it can change
;; arbitrarily).  By default, it uses the first two characters of the Private
;; Use Area of the Unicode BMP, viz. U+E000 and U+E001.  If you need to use
;; those characters for some other purpose, set `fci-eol-char' and
;; `fci-blank-char' to different values.

;; Troubleshooting
;; ===============

;; o Fci-mode is intended to be used with monospaced fonts.  If you're using
;;   a monospaced font and the fill-column rule is missing or misaligned on a
;;   few lines but otherwise appears normal, then most likely (a) there are
;;   non-ascii characters on those lines that are being displayed using a
;;   non-monospaced font, or (b) your font-lock settings use bold or italics
;;   and those font variants aren't monospaced.

;; o Although the XBM and PBM formats are natively supported by Emacs, the
;;   implementations are different in different ports and sometimes
;;   incomplete; for example, on some ports XBM images are always drawn in
;;   black.  Explicitly setting `fci-rule-image-format' to a different value
;;   will usually resolve such issues.

;; Known Issues
;; ============

;; o The indicator extends only to end of the buffer contents (as opposed to
;;   running the full length of the editing window).

;; o When portions of a buffer are invisible, such as when outline-mode is
;;   used to hide certain lines, the fill-column rule is hidden as well.

;; o Fci-mode should work smoothly when simultaneously displaying the same
;;   buffer on both a graphical display and on a character terminal.  It does
;;   not currently support simultaneous display of the same buffer on window
;;   frames with different default font sizes. (It would be feasible to
;;   support this use case, but thus far there seems to be no demand for
;;   it.)

;; o An issue specific to the Mac OS X (NextStep) port, versions 23.0-23.2:
;;   Emacs won't, in these particular versions, draw a cursor on top of an
;;   image.  Thus on graphical displays the cursor will disappear when
;;   positioned directly on top of the fill-column rule.  The best way to
;;   deal with this is to upgrade to v23.3 or v24 (or downgrade to v22).  If
;;   that isn't practical, a fix is available via the mini-package
;;   fci-osx-23-fix.el, which can be downloaded from:
;;
;;     github.com/alpaker/Fill-Column-Indicator
;;
;;  Directions for its use are given in the file header.

;; Todo
;; ====

;; o Accommodate non-nil values of `hl-line-sticky-flag' and similar cases.

;; o Accommodate linum-mode more robustly.

;; o Compatibility with non-nil `show-trailing-whitespace.'

;;    image.  (This handles both font changes and also cases where we
;;    activate the mode while displaying on a char terminal then subsequently
;;    display the buffer on a window frame.)
;; 3. If the value of `tab-width' or `fill-column' has changed, we reset the
;;    rule.  (We could set things up so that the rule adjusted automatically
;;    to such changes, but (a) it's slower, and (b) it wouldn't work on v22
;;    or v23.)
;; 4. Cursor properties are ignored when they're out of sight because of
;;    horizontal scrolling.  We detect such situations and force a return
;;    from hscrolling to bring our requested cursor position back into view.
