The original inspirations for paredit were Interlisp-D's structure
editor `SEdit' -- a real structure editor, not a cheesy imitation like
paredit -- and Guillaume Germain's sedit.el for GNU Emacs.

The following people have contributed to paredit in some way -- by
submitting patches, by discussing design, by testing paredit and
finding broken corner cases, &c.  It is not complete: most of those who
contributed via IRC are missing, for example, and I started this list
long after I ought to have.  If your name is not listed here and you
think it should be, or if your name is listed here and you would rather
that it not be, then let me know.
