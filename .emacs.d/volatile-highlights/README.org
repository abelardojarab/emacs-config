* volatile-highlights.el --- Minor mode for visual feedback on some operations.

** OVERVIEW

This library provides minor mode `volatile-highlights-mode', which
brings visual feedback to some operations by highlighting portions
relating to the operations.

All of highlights made by this library will be removed
when any new operation is executed.


** INSTALLING

To install this library, save the file "volatile-highlights.el" to a directory
in your =load-path= (you can view the current =load-path= using
=C-h v load-path <RET>= within Emacs), then add following
lines to your =.emacs= start up file:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (require 'volatile-highlights)
  (volatile-highlights-mode t)
#+END_EXAMPLE


** USING

To toggle volatile highlighting, type:

: M-x volatile-highlights-mode <RET>

While this minor mode is on, a string `VHL' will be displayed on the modeline.

Currently, operations listed below will be highlighted While the minor mode
`volatile-highlights-mode' is on:

    - =undo= ::
      Volatile highlights will be put on the text inserted by =undo=.

    - =yank= and =yank-pop= ::
      Volatile highlights will be put on the text inserted by =yank='
      or =yank-pop=.

    - =kill-region=,  =kill-line=,  any other killing function ::
      Volatile highlights will be put at the positions where the
      killed text used to be.

    - =delete-region= ::
      Same as =kill-region=,  but not as reliable since
      =delete-region= is an inline function.

    - =find-tag= ::
      Volatile highlights will be put on the tag name which was found
      by =find-tag=.

    - =occur-mode-goto-occurrence= and =occur-mode-display-occurrence= ::
      Volatile highlights will be put on the occurrence which is selected
      by =occur-mode-goto-occurrence= or =occur-mode-display-occurrence=.

    - Non incremental search operations ::
      Volatile highlights will be put on the the text found by
      commands listed below:

        : nonincremental-search-forward
        : nonincremental-search-backward
        : nonincremental-re-search-forward
        : nonincremental-re-search-backward
        : nonincremental-repeat-search-forward
        : nonincremental-repeat-search-backward

Highlighting support for each operations can be turned on/off individually
via customization. Also check out the customization group by:
