#+TITLE: Metaweblog

=metaweblog= is an emacs library to access metaweblog based
weblogs.  It is an extension of the original code written by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AshishShukla][Ashish

This code used to reside inside [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog]], but it has been moved to a
separate repo upon a [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog/issues/52][request]] by [[http://bytebaker.com/][Shrutarshi Basu]].
