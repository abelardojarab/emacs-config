# Installation #

You can use built-in package manager (package.el) or do everything by
your hands.

## Using package manager ##

This theme is available on two repositories:
[MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/) and
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/). Add the following to your
emacs config file somewhere (.emacs, init.el, whatever)

```
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
```

for [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/), or

```
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/") t)
```

for [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/).

I personally prefer [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/), 'cause it
hourly updates its packages from upstream source.

Then use `M-x package-install RET gruber-darker-theme RET` to install
the theme. Use `M-x customize-themes` to change your current theme.

## Manual old fashioned way ##

Download the theme to your local directory. You can do it through `git
clone` command:

```
git clone git://github.com/rexim/gruber-darker-theme.git
```

Then add path to gruber-darker-theme to custom-theme-load-path list â€”
add the following to your emacs config file somewhere (.emacs,
init.el, whatever):

```
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path
             "/path/to/gruber-darker-theme/")
```

Use `M-x customize-themes` to change your current theme.

# Contribution #

Gruber Darker is an awesome theme. But it has a lack of support for
many good modes. I add color faces only for modes I use. If you like
this theme and use a mode that looks very bad with it, feel free to
add appropriate color faces (see file gruber-darker-theme.el) and send
me a pull request.

Thanks.
