# Darkokai ðŸŒ‘
A dark variant of [oneKelvinSmithâ€™s Monokai port](https://github.com/oneKelvinSmith/monokai-emacs) for Emacs. This came about as I had an ever-growing unorganised list of overrides and tweaks on Monokai which eventually began to emerge into its own style.

## Installation

#### MELPA (`package.el`)

Darkokai has been merged into [MELPA](http://melpa.org) and should appear in your `package-list-packages` pretty soon. You can install it with `M-x package-install darkokai-theme`, and load it on startup by placing this in your init file:

```elisp
(load-theme 'darkokai t)
```

#### [`use-package`](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package)

With MELPA configured in your `package-archives`:

```elisp
(use-package darkokai-theme
  :ensure t
  :config (load-theme 'darkokai t))
```

#### Manual

Place `darkokai-theme.el` in your `custom-theme-load-path` and load on init. For example:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/etc/themes")
(load-theme 'darkokai t)
```

## Notes

To disable the padded mode-line and use the normal mode-line look:

```elisp
(setq darkokai-mode-line-padding 1) ;; Default mode-line box width
(load-theme 'darkokai t)
```

Terminal support is there, but some of the base terminal colours still need to be updated to match the GUI colours. If the colours look particularly bad in terminal, make sure youâ€™re using a 256 color term by adding the following to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`:

```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
```
