* Get all the emacs keys working in the Linux Console
This adds support for some of the chords that doesn't work by default when running emacs in the Linux Console, such as a range of combination of arrows, =C=, =M=, =S= and =RET=. I use org pretty extensively, and all of the keys for that should be covered.

Note: This works for the Linux Console (the one you're in before starting X) but it doesn't necessarrily work for terminal emulators in X.

** Config
Load =keys.txt= to the keymap by putting this somewhere appropriate like =/etc/rc.local=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
loadkeys /path/to/keys.txt
#+END_SRC

Load =keys.el= by putting this somewhere in your emacs init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(load "/path/to/keys.el")
#+END_SRC

That's it.
