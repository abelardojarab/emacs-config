* Emacs Dashboard
A shameless extraction of Spacemacs' startup screen.

* Features
  1. Displays an awesome Emacs banner!
  2. Recent files
  3. Bookmarks list
  4. Recent projectile projects list (Depends on `projectile` package)

* Screenshot

[[./screenshot.png]]

* Dependencies
You will need the following packages which are all available on Melpa:

1. page-break-lines - [[https://github.com/purcell/page-break-lines]]
2. (optional) projectile - [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile]]

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
M-x package-install RET dashboard
#+END_SRC

 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'dashboard)
(dashboard-setup-startup-hook)
;; Or if you use use-package
(use-package dashboard
  :config
  (dashboard-setup-startup-hook))
 #+END_SRC

By default, this will show two lists, recent files and bookmarks.
One more widget is implemented by Dashboard but it's made optional because of it's dependency on a third party application, which is
`projects` which shows you the list of known projectile projects.

To customize which widgets are displayed, you can use the following snippet
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq dashboard-items '((recents  . 5)
                        (bookmarks . 5)
			(projects . 5)))
 #+END_SRC
This will add the recent files, bookmarks and the projects widgets to your dashboard each displaying 5 items.

To add your own custom widget is pretty easy, define your widget's callback function and add it to `dashboard-items` as such:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun dashboard-insert-custom ()
  (insert "Custom text"))
(add-to-list 'dashboard-item-generators  '(custom . dashboard-insert-custom))
(add-to-list 'dashboard-items '(custom) t)
 #+END_SRC

To contribute your changes to this package, please do the following:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone a local copy
3. Make your changes
4. Push and create your PR

If you'd like to test the package before pushing, my current way of testing is by executing `package-install-file`.
Emacs will bundle and install the package into your ~/.emacs.d/elpa and then you are able to start Emacs and check that your implementation works.

Contributions are very welcome :)
