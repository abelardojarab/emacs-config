** About

This Emacs package provides a way to use =imenu= indexes on multiple
buffers (or files).

Above that, =imenus= may be used to perform =isearch= or =occur= on
specified buffers by pressing an according key binding.

** Installation

*** Automatic

This package can be installed from [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]] (with =M-x package-install= or
=M-x list-packages=).

*** Manual

For the manual installation, clone the repo, add the directory to
=load-path= and add autoloads for the commands/functions you need:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/imenus-dir")
(autoload 'imenus "imenus" nil t)
(autoload 'imenus-mode-buffers "imenus" nil t)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

- =M-x imenus=

  This command behaves almost the same as =M-x imenu=.  The differences
  are:

  + If it is called with a prefix argument, you will be prompted for
    several buffers for searching.

  + You may use the following additional key bindings while you are in a
    minibuffer prompt (the bindings may be changed in
    =imenus-minibuffer-map=):

    * =M-r= - Rescan the current index.
    * =M-s= - Start Isearch with the current input string.
    * =M-o= - Start Occur with the current input string.

  + There are no additional groups, like "Variables" or "Types".  All
    items are placed in the top level and optionally have a group prefix
    (i.e., "Variables â‡¨ imenus-delimiter").

- =M-x imenus-mode-buffers=

  Perform =imenus= on all buffers with a particular major mode (there is
  also [[https://github.com/vitoshka/imenu-anywhere][imenu-anywhere]] package for the same purpose).

- =imenus-files=

  This is not an interactive command; it is a function that may be used
  to perform =imenus= on files.  For example, I use it to search my
  elisp files (see [[https://github.com/alezost/emacs-utils/blob/master/utl-imenus.el][utl-imenus.el]]).
