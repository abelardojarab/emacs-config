;;; Commentary:

;; Purpose:
;;
;;  Mark and find your favorite things and org-locations easily:
;;  Create and update an index table of references and links.  When
;;  searching, frequently used entries appear at the top and entering
;;  some keywords narrows down to matching entries only, so that the
;;  right one can be spotted easily.
;;
;;  References are essentially small numbers (e.g. "R237" or "-455-"),
;;  as created by this package; they are well suited to be used
;;  outside of org.  Links are normal org-mode links.
;;
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;  - Add these lines to your .emacs (modify appropriately):
;;
;;    (require 'org-index)
;;    (org-index-default-keybindings)   ; optional
;;
;;  - Restart your Emacs to make these lines effective.
;;
;;  - Invoke `org-index', which will assist in creating your index
;;    table.  The variable org-index-id will be persisted within your
;;    customization file (typically .emacs).
;;
;;
;; Further reading:
;;
;;  See the documentation of `org-index', which can also be read
;;  by invoking `org-index' and choosing the help-command.
;;
;;
;; Updates:
;;
;;  The latest tested version of this file can always be found at:

(defun org-index (&optional command)
  "Mark and find your favorite things and org-locations easily:
Create and update an index table of references and links.  When
searching, frequently used entries appear at the top and entering
some keywords narrows down to matching entries only, so that the
right one can be spotted easily.

References are essentially small numbers (e.g. \"R237\" or \"-455-\"),
as created by this package; they are well suited to be used
outside of org.  Links are normal `org-mode' links.


This is version 3.0.2 of org-index.el .


The function `org-index' operates on a dedicated table, the index
table, which lives within its own Org-mode node.  The table and
its containing node will be created, when you first invoke
`org-index'.  The node will have some comments, describing the
columns of the index table and their associated flags.  The index
table is found through the id of the containing node, which is
stored within the variable `org-index-id'.


The function `org-index' is the only interactive function of this
package and its main entry point; once invoked it asks, which of
it subcommands to execute:

  occur: Incremental search, that shows matching lines from the
    index table, updated after every keystroke.  You may enter a
    list of words seperated by space or comma (\",\"), to select
    lines that contain all of the given words.

  add: Add the current node to your index, so that it can be
    found through the subcommand \"occur\".

  delete: Delete the current node from your index.

  head: Ask for a reference number and search for an entry, which
    either has this reference contained in its heading or within
    its property org-index-ref.

  enter: Enter index table and maybe go to a specific reference.

  leave: Leave the index table and return to your previous location.

  ref: Create a new reference.

  help: Show this text.

  example: Create a temporary index, that will not be saved, but
    may serve as an example.

  reorder: Temporarily reorder the index table, e.g. by count,
    reference or last access.

  sort: Sort a set of lines (either from the active region or the
    whole buffer) by references found in each line.

  multi-occur: Apply Emacs standard `multi-occur' operation on all
    `org-mode' buffers to search for the given reference.

  highlight: Highlight or unhiglight references in active region or buffer.

  statistics : Show some statistics (e.g. minimum and maximum
    reference) about index table.

If you invoke `org-index' for the first time, an assistant will be
invoked, that helps you to create your own, commented index.

Use `org-index-default-keybindings' to establish convenient
keyboard shortcuts.

Optional argument COMMAND is a symbol naming the command to execute."
