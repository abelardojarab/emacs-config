Magit is currently in feature freeze.  Please keep that in mind
when suggesting new features or submitting code contributions.

No new features will be implemented on the `master` branch, even
if they are "obviously not going to cause any problems" (this has
frequently turned out not to be true after all).  Even for bugfixes
the treshhold is fairly high now; if fixing a bug which has existed
for years seems risky, then it won't be fixed now.

Very few new features will be implemented on the `next` branch.
Basically only features that help *fixing* existing features might
be implemented despite the feature freeze.

If you feal that your issue or new feature is important enough to
violate the above restrictions, then please explicitly note that you
have read this and explain in your initial post why you feel an
exception should be made.  That way I at least do not have to repeat
the above yet once more.

Please also consider whether your feature really is important enough
that implementing it now is justification enough to further delay the
release of the many new and many more improved features in `next`.

Also see the [Roadmap toward 2.1.0](https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/1645).
