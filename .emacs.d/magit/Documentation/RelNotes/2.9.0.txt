Magit v2.8.1 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Changes since v2.8.0
--------------------

* The new option `magit-branch-adjust-remote-upstream-alist' can be
  used to configure what branch to use as upstream when branching a
  remote branch.  Without setting this option the upstream ends up
  being the same branch as the one referred to by the push-remote.

* The command `magit-branch-spinoff' learned to remove only a subset
  of commits from the previously current branch, instead of resetting
  it to its upstream, when the region selects commits reachable from
  HEAD.

* The new option `magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-face' and
  `magit-diff-unmarked-lines-keep-foreground' (which was previously
  defined as an undocumented variable) allow tuning the appearance
  of the hunk-internal region.

  The new function `magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-face',
  provides a new style; it makes the hunk-internal region bold (or
  italic).  I recommend you customize the above option to use this
  instead of one of the functions mentioned below.

  The new functions `magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-overlay'
  and `magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-overlay' draw one-pixel
  lines before and after the hunk-internal region.  Both of these
  functions have glitches and due to limitations of Emacs' display
  engine it is not possible to fix those.  #2758

* Added command `magit-find-git-config-file' and variants, to make it
  easier to open a file located in the git directory, when ".git" is
  a regular file.

* The environment variable `INSIDE_EMACS' is now set when calling git.

* The `--gpg-sign=' option is now available from the revert popup
  also.

* The `--sort=' option is now available from the show-refs popup.
  (Use "C-u y" to show the popup instead of invoking its default
  action as "y" does.)

Fixes since v2.8.0
------------------

* Command `magit-list-repositories' failed on empty Git repositories.

* The Git variable `pull.rebase' was ignored when determining whether
  the current branch is being rebased onto its upstream in order to
  display that information in the status buffer.

* When `--force-with-lease' was added to the `magit-push-popup',
  `--force' was removed, but sometimes the former just isn't enough.

* On 32bit systems `magit-format-log-margin' failed because it tried
  to truncate a time float that was to large for that.  #2765

* On Emacs v25.1 the hunk-internal region flashed briefly on
  mouse-down-1 events and the delimiting horizontal lines could end
  up having the height of a regular line instead of just a single
  pixel.  #2758

* The caching mechanism that was supposed to ensure that sections of
  unpulled and unpushed remain collapsed even when they disappear for
  a while was broken.
