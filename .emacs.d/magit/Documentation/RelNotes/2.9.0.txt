Magit v2.9.0 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Changes since v2.8.0
--------------------

* The new option `magit-branch-adjust-remote-upstream-alist' can be
  used to configure what branch to use as upstream when branching a
  remote branch.  Without setting this option the upstream ends up
  being the same branch as the one referred to by the push-remote.

* The per-refresh cache, which is used to save calls to git because
  that is surprisingly slow on Windows, has been improved for calls to
  `git config'.  Instead of just avoiding identical calls to `git
  config' as for other sub-commands, we now call `git config --list'
  only once per refresh to obtain a list of all variables and their
  values.

* Visiting a file or blob by pressing "RET" (or always visiting the
  file by pressing "M-RET") while point is inside a diff has been
  improved in several ways.

  The position we jump to is now accurate even when jumping to the
  file in the working tree from a diff that wasn't about changes in
  the working tree.

  If, and only if, point is on a removed line in the diff, then we
  jump to the last commit which still had that line, not the commit
  which removed that line.  Staged changes are currently excluded from
  this new behavior, and it can be disabled completely using the new
  option `magit-diff-visit-previous-blob'.

  If, and only if, the file/blob buffer is narrowed to a region that
  does not include the position we jump to, then it is widened first.

* The new options `magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-functions' and
  `magit-diff-unmarked-lines-keep-foreground' (which was previously
  defined as an undocumented variable) allow tuning the appearance
  of the hunk-internal region.

  The new function `magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-face',
  provides a new style; it makes the hunk-internal region bold (or
  italic).  I recommend you customize the above option to use this
  function instead of one of the functions mentioned below.

  The new functions `magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-overlay'
  and `magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-overlay' draw one-pixel
  lines before and after the hunk-internal region.  Both of these
  functions have (different) glitches and due to limitations of Emacs'
  display engine it is not possible to fix those.  #2758

* Added command `magit-find-git-config-file' and variants to make it
  easier to open a file located in the git directory when ".git" is
  a regular file whose contents describe the location of the real git
  directory.

* The command `magit-branch-spinoff' learned to remove only a subset
  of commits from the previously current branch, instead of resetting
  it to its upstream, when the region selects commits reachable from
  HEAD.

* The command `magit-branch-delete' now falls back to deleting the
  tracking branch when the user attempts to delete a remote branch
  which does not actually exist on the remote anymore.

* The command `magit-diff-dwim' learned about additional cases.  On
  a non-current branch it now shows the diff for "CURRENT...BRANCH"
  (instead of "BRANCH..CURRENT") and inside a stash buffer it shows
  the diff for the commit at point.

* The command `magit-push', which "o" is bound to in the push popup,
  now offers the push-branch as default choice.  Only if that is not
  set does it default to the upstream as before.  And when pushing a
  commit that is reachable from HEAD, then it offers to push to the
  push-branch or upstream of the current branch (which still has to
  be forced explicitly).

* Added option `magit-no-confirm-default' to allow specifying commands
  which should just use the default choice instead of having the user
  confirm that by pressing RET.  I recommend you don't use this, but
  if you think that the defaults are so good that you always want to
  use them, then this might make it a bit easier for you.

* Added option `magit-slow-confirm' for users who are afraid they
  would answer `y-or-n-p' questions to quickly.  One action, deleting
  all stashes, now defaults to having to be confirmed with "yes RET".

* The option `magit-branch-prefer-remote-upstream' now also supports
  regexps as members instead of only complete branch names.

* The option `magit-branch-read-upstream-first' used to be a boolean.
  Now it supports a third value `fallback', which means to read the
  upstream first like `t', but if the value provided by the user does
  not reference an existing revision, then it is treated as the name of
  the new branch and the upstream is read using the second prompt, as
  if the value of this option were `nil'.

* By default Git-Commit no longer complains about a summary line that
  is too long by some standards.  If you actually want it to complain
  about that, then customize `git-commit-style-convention-checks'.

* When deleting a stash, the hash is now logged to the process log
  buffer in addition to *Messages*, making it more likely that a
  user who accidentally deleted a stash would find the information
  required to undo that.

* The environment variable `INSIDE_EMACS' is now set when calling git.

* Added the `--gpg-sign=' option to the revert popup.

* Added the `--sort=' option to the show-refs popup.  (Use "C-u y" to
  show the popup instead of invoking its default action as "y" does.)

* Added new faces `git-rebase-comment-heading'
  and `git-rebase-comment-hash'.

* `whitespace-mode' is not compatible with Magit buffers, where it is
  now actively prevented from being turned on by the user.

* Hunk refinement is now faster.  Users who previously set
  `magit-diff-refine-hunk' to nil due to performance issues may find
  that it now works well even when set to `all'.

Fixes since v2.8.0
------------------

* The command `magit-list-repositories' failed on empty repositories.

* The Git variable `pull.rebase' was ignored when determining whether
  the current branch is being rebased onto its upstream in order to
  display that information in the status buffer.

* On 32bit systems `magit-format-log-margin' failed because it tried
  to truncate a time float that was too large for that.  #2765

* On Emacs v25.1 the hunk-internal region flashed briefly on
  mouse-down-1 events and the delimiting horizontal lines could end
  up having the height of a regular line instead of just a single
  pixel.  #2758

* On Windows, when using a `windows-nt' Emacs together with a cygwin
  Git, we failed to instruct Emacs to not use dos shell quoting when
  calling git.

* The encoding of commit messages is controlled by the Git variable
  `i18n.logOutputEncoding' but we failed to take that into account.
  Fixes by setting `i18n.logOutputEncoding' to UTF-8, but only inside
  Magit and only for `window-nt'.

* The caching mechanism that is supposed to ensure that sections of
  unpulled and unpushed commits remain collapsed even when they
  disappear was broken for a while.

* Process sentinels did not in all cases ensure that the correct
  buffer was current before doing something that assumes that this is
  the case.  Almost always that did not matter because it was the case
  anyway, but if other timers are running then it is possible that
  those make the wrong buffer current.

* The commands `magit-clone' and `magit-init' did not work over Tramp.

* The commands `magit-worktree-checkout' and `magit-worktree-branch'
  did not expand the path they pass to git, which is necessary because
  git does not know the meaning of "~/".

* The commands which create fixup/squash commands and then immediately
  squash them into the target commit did not remove the `--gpg-sign'
  switch.  Signing such commits is not only unnecessary; unless the
  passphrase was cached earlier trying to sign resulted in the process
  indefinitely waiting for the passphrase to arrive with no way for
  the user to actually provide it.

* Depending on the value of `magit-save-repository-buffers' the user
  might have been asked whether s/he wants to save "git-rebase-todo",
  which is never necessary and just a distraction.

* Directories whose names begin with a period were filtered out when
  using `magit-repository-directories' to calculate a list of repos.

* The user name and email, which are displayed when reading a gpg key
  from the user, were not stripped from the chosen value before being
  handed of to git.

* When visiting a directory by displaying a Dired buffer, we used to
  display a buffer for the parent of the directory in question and
  placed point on the name of the directory.  But the intention always
  was to show the Dired buffer for the directory itself.

* Visiting or deleting a submodule listed inside "Modules" failed.
  The latter is now done by de-initalizing the module.

* The highlighting of a non-empty second line in a commit message was
  not automatically updated.

* When `--force-with-lease' was added to the `magit-push-popup',
  `--force' was removed, but sometimes the former just isn't enough.

* The face `magit-diff-file-heading-highlight' used to inherit from
  `magit-diff-file-heading', which by default makes text bold.  That
  resulted in the complete current heading to be bold, but only the
  file-name part is supposed to be bold.

This release also contains typofixes, documentation updates,
code clean-ups, and other small bug fixes and improvements.
