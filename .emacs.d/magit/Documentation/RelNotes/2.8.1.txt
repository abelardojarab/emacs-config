Magit v2.8.1 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Changes since v2.6.1
--------------------

* The `--gpg-sign=' option is now also available from the revert
  popup.

Fixes since v2.8.0
------------------

* Command `magit-list-repositories' failed on empty git repositories.

* The Git variable `pull.rebase' was ignored when determining whether
  the current branch is being rebased onto its upstream in order to
  display that information in the status buffer.

* When `--force-with-lease' was added to the `magit-push-popup',
  `--force' was removed, but sometimes the former just isn't enough.
