Magit v2.9.1 Release Notes (unreleased)
=======================================

Changes since v2.9.0
--------------------

* The function `magit-display-buffer' now sets the focus on the frame
  used to display the selected window.  #2865

* The Custom groups are better organized now.  New groups were added,
  but many options also moved between groups that already existed
  before.  422d776e, 33c5c1ca

* Many Custom groups and options now link to the relevant Info nodes
  and to other relevant options.  810d7fb4

* Many doc-strings were improved, added, and fixed.  47aae617

* The obsolete variable `magit-repository-directory-depth' is no
  longer defined as an option.  09993c39

Fixes since v2.9.0
------------------

* Customizations of hooks were ignored, if the `custom-set-variables'
  form was evaluated before the Magit libraries were loaded.  #2902

* When rebase stopped at a commit, point was no longer placed on that
  commit.  #2884

* When creating a commit, `magit-display-buffer-fullcolumn-most-v1'
  filled the entire frame, hiding the commit message buffer.  #2891

* The commands `magit-reflog' and `magit-reflog-current' reported
  a revision's reflog as empty when the name of a file in the
  repository, relative to the top-level directory, matched the
  revision name.  5264ffcb

* The function `magit-repolist-column-upstream' returned the current
  branch instead of its upstream.  46acbd6d

* The functions `magit-repolist-column-unpulled-from-upstream' and
  `magit-repolist-column-unpushed-to-upstream' raised a type error
  if the upstream was configured but did not exist.  #2904

* The default values of the options `magit-submodule-list-columns'
  and `magit-repolist-columns' didn't match the documentation and the
  Custom type.  But the code that that uses these values is resilient
  against that defect and so the only effect was that the values were
  reported as mismatched in the Custom interface.  79f6af23

* The Custom type of option `magit-update-other-window-delay' didn't
  match the default value.  eb6d8bde

* The shell command generated by `magit-emacs-Q-command' could end
  up trying to load a directory as a library, due to a bug in Emacs.
