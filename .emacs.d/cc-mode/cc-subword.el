;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides `subword' oriented commands and a minor mode
;; (`c-subword-mode') that substitutes the common word handling
;; functions with them.

;; In spite of GNU Coding Standards, it is popular to name a symbol by
;; mixing uppercase and lowercase letters, e.g. "GtkWidget",
;; "EmacsFrameClass", "NSGraphicsContext", etc.  Here we call these
;; mixed case symbols `nomenclatures'.  Also, each capitalized (or
;; completely uppercase) part of a nomenclature is called a `subword'.
;; Here are some examples:

;;  Nomenclature           Subwords
;;  ===========================================================
;;  GtkWindow          =>  "Gtk" and "Window"
;;  EmacsFrameClass    =>  "Emacs", "Frame" and "Class"
;;  NSGraphicsContext  =>  "NS", "Graphics" and "Context"

;; The subword oriented commands defined in this package recognize
;; subwords in a nomenclature to move between them and to edit them as
;; words.

;; In the minor mode, all common key bindings for word oriented
;; commands are overridden by the subword oriented commands:

;; Key     Word oriented command      Subword oriented command
;; ============================================================
;; M-f     `forward-word'             `c-forward-subword'
;; M-b     `backward-word'            `c-backward-subword'
;; M-@     `mark-word'                `c-mark-subword'
;; M-d     `kill-word'                `c-kill-subword'
;; M-DEL   `backward-kill-word'       `c-backward-kill-subword'
;; M-t     `transpose-words'          `c-transpose-subwords'
;; M-c     `capitalize-word'          `c-capitalize-subword'
;; M-u     `upcase-word'              `c-upcase-subword'
;; M-l     `downcase-word'            `c-downcase-subword'
;;
;; Note: If you have changed the key bindings for the word oriented
;; commands in your .emacs or a similar place, the keys you've changed
;; to are also used for the corresponding subword oriented commands.

;; To make the mode turn on automatically, put the following code in
;; your .emacs:
;;
;; (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
;; 	  (lambda () (c-subword-mode 1)))
;;

;; Acknowledgment:
;; The regular expressions to detect subwords are mostly based on
;; the old `c-forward-into-nomenclature' originally contributed by
;; Terry_Glanfield dot Southern at rxuk dot xerox dot com.

In spite of GNU Coding Standards, it is popular to name a symbol by
mixing uppercase and lowercase letters, e.g. \"GtkWidget\",
\"EmacsFrameClass\", \"NSGraphicsContext\", etc.  Here we call these
mixed case symbols `nomenclatures'. Also, each capitalized (or

Here are some examples:

The subword oriented commands activated in this minor mode recognize
subwords in a nomenclature to move between subwords and to edit them
as words.
