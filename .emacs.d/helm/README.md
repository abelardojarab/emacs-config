## Abstract

`Helm` is incremental completion and selection narrowing framework for
Emacs. It will help steer you in the right direction when you're looking
for stuff in Emacs (like buffers, files, etc).

Helm is a fork of `anything.el` originaly written by Tamas Patrovic
and can be considered to be its successor. 
`Helm` sets out to clean up the legacy code in `anything.el`
and provide a cleaner, leaner and more modular tool, that's not tied in
the trap of backward compatibility. 

## Requirements

You need a recent Emacs to use latest helm, at least Emacs-24.3.

## Getting Started

### Quick install

  1. Clone the `helm` repository to some directory:
  
    ```elisp
    $ git clone https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm.git /path/to/helm/directory
    ```
  
  2. Run `make` from this directory.
  3. Add to `.emacs.el` (or equivalent):

    ```elisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/helm/directory")
    (require 'helm-config)
    ```
_NOTE:_ Installing helm like this (i.e from git+make) is the safest way.

Alternatively, you can have a quick try to helm by launching from the helm directory:

`./emacs-helm.sh`

Note that this will not work on Windows systems.

### Install from Emacs packaging system

Helm is now available on Melpa at `http://melpa.milkbox.net/`
You will find there instructions to install.

_WARNING:_ Due to a bad concept of package.el which is in charge of fetching helm files
and compiling them, expect errors most of the time when upgrading from melpa and `list-package`.
To avoid this you will have to compile your new files outside of your current emacs running helm.
People installing from git and using make file will not suffer from this problem.
See [FAQ](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki#faq) for more infos.

**Note to Linux Distributions Maintainers**

`Only the extensions present in the github emacs-helm organisation are supported.`

### Alternate install warning

Some people are installing `helm` with their own config using diverses `require`, `autoload`
and other hacks, not using `helm-config`.
Expect failures and slowdown at startup unless you really know what you are doing when you do so.

### Emacs Prelude

If you're afraid to play with Emacs's configuration, but want to try
out Helm - have NO FEAR. Have a look at
[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) - it has
Helm built-in and properly set-up.

### Basic usage

Just type `M-x helm-mini` and enjoy. You might want to bind that command to
a keyboard shortcut. Here's a suggestion:

```elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c h") 'helm-mini)
```
You can also start with `M-x helm-mode` and enjoy helm completion in your favourites
Emacs commands (e.g `M-x`, `C-x C-f`, etc...).
You can enable this by adding in your init file:

```elisp
(helm-mode 1)
```

As a startup point you can also look at the helm section in Emacs menu to
discover some of the commands provided by helm.

### Advanced usage

Helm is capable of a lot. Here is a demo of `helm-buffers-list`:

![helm-buffers-list](doc/helm-buffers-list.gif)

The demo starts when you see `Eval: START` in the minibuffer.

- All the C buffers are selected using the regexp `*C`. In the demo, I also select Tcl buffers with `*Tcl` and then switched back to C buffers with `*C`.
- I only want to have buffers that contains only the string "crash". To do that, I add a space, then add the pattern `@crash`.
- After the initial search pattern, I hand over the current matching buffers to `helm-moccur` - `moccur` with Helm interface. In the above demo, I only switch to one file, that is `kexec.c`. However, you can select multiple buffers with `C-SPC` or select all buffers with `M-a`.
- Candidates can be filtered gradually by adding more pattern, i.e. I added `memory` to filtered down to buffers that contain the string "memory" among the buffers that are containing "crash".

As you can see, as you filtered out, the number of candidates decreases, as displayed in the modeline. At the end, there were 12 buffers remained as the result of filtering, down from the total 253 buffers.
