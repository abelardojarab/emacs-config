under the name org-journal. You may also want to specify the directory
where your journal files will be saved. You can do this by setting the
variable =org-journal-dir= (remember to add a trailing slash).
=org-journal-dir= is also a customizable variable. The default value
for =org-journal-dir= is =~/Documents/journal/=.

You can add all those calendar files to your org-agenda by adding
=org-journal-dir= to =org-agenda-files= and setting
=org-agenda-file-regexp= to include files with an all-numeric name
(=\\`[^.].*\\.org'\\|[0-9]+=). That way, you can use org-agenda to
search for /TODO/ items or tagged items in your org-journal.

Inside the journal directory, a separate file is created for each day
with a journal entry, with a file name in the format /YYYYMMDD/. Each
journal entry is an org-mode file that begins with a date entry on the
top, followed by a entries for different times. Any subsequent entries
on the same day are written as additional headings in the same file,
with their own time. To start writing a journal entry, press =C-c j=.

You can customize the date and time formats using the variables
=org-journal-date-format= and =org-journal-time-format=. If you do not
want to use org headings and sub-headings for date and time entries,
customize =org-journal-date-prefix= and =org-journal-time-prefix=. For
example, you could set =org-journal-date-prefix= to =#+TITLE:= in
order to begin every file with a title instead of a heading. If you
want to store your journal entries with different file names,
customize =org-journal-file-format=.

You can browse through existing journal entries on disk via the
calendar. All dates for which an entry is present are highlighted.
Pressing =j= will open it up for viewing. Pressing =[= or =]= will
select the date with the previous or next journal entry, respectively.
Pressing =i j= will create a new entry for the chosen date.

Quick summary:
To create a new journal entry: =C-c j=

In calendar view:
- =j= to view an entry
- =i j= to add a new entry
- =[= to go to previous entry
- =]= to go to next entry

When viewing a journal entry:
- =C-c f= to view next entry
- =C-c b= to view previous entry

A typical journal entry for a day would look like this:

(it will actually look a lot nicer, depending on your org-mode settings)

  ** 10:28 Company meeting
  Endless discussions about projects. Not much progress

  ** 11:33 Work on org-journal                                   :org-journal:
  For the longest time, I wanted to have a cool diary app on my
  computer. However, I simply lacked the right tool for that job. After
  many hours of searching, I finally found PersonalDiary on EmacsWiki.
  PersonalDiary is a very simple diary system based on the emacs
  calendar. It works pretty well, but I don't really like that it only
  uses unstructured text.

  Thus, I spent the last two hours with making that diary use org-mode
  and represent every entry as an org-mode headline. Very cool!

  ** 15:33 Work on org-journal                                   :org-journal:
  Now my journal automatically creates the right headlines (adds the
  current time stamp if on the current day, does not add a time stamp
  for any other day). Additionally, it automatically collapses the
  headlines in the org-file to the right level (shows everything if in
  view mode, shows only headlines in new-entry-mode). Emacs and elisp
  are really cool!

  ** 16:40 Work on org-journal                                   :org-journal:
  I uploaded my journal mode to marmalade and Github! Awesome!
