** Org buffer (with code)

Fontified source code blocks:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 640
[[./images/fontified-src-code-blocks.png]]

Note that, to get the whole heading lines fontified, you need to add the
following line into your =.emacs= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Fontify the whole line for headings (with a background color).
(setq org-fontify-whole-heading-line t)
#+end_src

** Agenda

Agenda with task list:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 640

* Install it

Though Leuven-theme has been added in *Emacs 24.4* (October 2014), you can get
a fresh version of it, at any time, from [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]] or from [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme/][GitHub]].

** Install the ELPA package

In Emacs 24.x, ~M-x list-packages~ is the /recommended way/ to list and install
packages.

MELPA keeps stable releases of Leuven theme.

See http://melpa.milkbox.net/#installing for more information on how to install
~leuven-theme~:

1. Just add MELPA to ~package-archives~,

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   ;; Archives from which to fetch.
   (setq package-archives
         (append '(("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
                 package-archives))
   #+end_src

2. Call ~list-packages~,

3. Search for ~leuven-theme~,

4. Mark it for installation with ~i~, and

5. Execute the install action with ~x~.

** Install the Git version

Get the full Git repository at https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme
using the following command:

#+begin_src shell
git clone git://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme.git
#+end_src

Add the following in your =.emacs= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "/path/to/emacs-leuven-theme")
(load-theme 'leuven t)                  ; For Emacs 24+.
#+end_src

Restart Emacs.

** Customize it

You don't like my large Org level-1 headings (though I made them larger on
purpose!)?

You should be able to get my theme and a smaller face by using something such
as:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-face-attribute 'org-level-1 nil :height 90) ; 9 pt font.
#+end_src

That should change the font size without changing the colors.
