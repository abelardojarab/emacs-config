#+TITLE: helm-purpose
helm-purpose provides specialized [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/][Helm]] commands and sources for [[https://github.com/bmag/emacs-purpose/][Purpose]].

* Features
- helmize all Purpose commands
- special helm commands:
  + =helm-purpose-switch-buffer-with-purpose=: same as =helm-buffers-list=, but
    only list buffers with a specific purpose (default: same purpose as current
    buffer).
  + =helm-purpose-switch-buffer-with-some-purpose=: choose a purpose, then call
    =helm-purpose-switch-buffer-with-purpose=.
  + =helm-purpose-mini-ignore-purpose=: same as =helm-mini=, but ignore Purpose
    when displaying the buffer.

* Setup
Just call =helm-purpose-setup= in your init file. It will helmize all Purpose
commands, but won't change any key bindings. Alternatively, you can set
=purpose-preferred-prompt= to =helm= instead.

* Key Bindings
=helm-purpose= doesn't bind any keys, you are free to define your own bindings
as you please.
