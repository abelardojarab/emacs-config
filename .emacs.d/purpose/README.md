Purpose is a plugin for Emacs which introduces the concept of a
"purpose" for windows and buffers. By setting purposes for your windows
and for your buffers, Purpose helps you maintain a consistent window
layout easily.

For instance, if you find yourself switching between files, interpreter
buffers, help buffers and more, and have a hard time keeping the file
you are actually trying to work on visible, Purpose may be what you
need.


## Features

### Automatic purpose detection

The purpose of a window is the same as the purpose of its current
buffer. The purpose of buffer is determined by its name and its
mode. Purpose comes with a default confiuration, but you can set your
configuration by customizing `purpose-user-mode-purposes`,
`purpose-user-name-purposes` and `purpose-user-regexp-purposes`. The
documentation inside the code (purpose-configuration.el) provides more
information.

The purpose of a window is shown in its modeline, between square
brackets. If the window's purpose is dedicated, an exalamation mark
("!") is added after the purpose's name and before the closing
bracket.

### Purpose-aware display

Purpose uses advice to override the regular display functions with functions that
are purpose-aware. Also, Purpose provides you with purpose-aware commands.
The main commands are `purpose-switch-buffer` `purpose-pop-buffer`.
Furthermore, Purpose uses variable `display-buffer-overriding-action` to provide
purpose-awareness to function `display-buffer`.

Programmers can use the hook `purpose-select-buffer-hook` to execute code
after everytime that Purpose displays a buffer and selects its window.

### Purpose dedication

Commands `purpose-toggle-window-purpose-dedicated` and
`purpose-toggle-window-buffer-dedicated` let you mark a window as dedicated
to its current purpose or to its current buffer. Marking a window's
purpose as dedicated means that Purpose won't use this window for
buffers with other purposes. Marking a window's buffer as dedicated
means that it won't be used for other buffers, even if they have the
same purpose. Buffer dedication is a built-in Emacs feature, which
Purpose knows to respect.

### Persistent window layout

Purpose lets you save and load your window layout with commands such as
`purpose-save-window-layout` and `purpose-load-window-layout`.

Programmers can use the hooks `purpose-set-window-properties-functions` and
`purpose-get-extra-window-params-function` to save/load other window
properties that may interest them.
