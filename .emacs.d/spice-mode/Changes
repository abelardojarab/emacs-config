Changes 

Release 1.2.25 (03 January 2007)
==============

* moved over source tree

Release 1.2.24 (01 November 2004)
==============

+ incorporated Matthew Mundell's patch:
  - echo intro
  - keybinding changes to be compliant with manual's specifications
  - some elisp fixes

+ added analysis modifier keywords to all spice standards, with font-locking

+ modified instance name regexp

+ modified match variable name font-locking for Xemacs21.4.11 on windows

+ changed url to point to spice-mode.4t.com site

Release 1.2.23 (29 March 2003)
==============

+ spectre spice compatibility submode. Spice-mode now also recognizes some
  spectre extensions to the spice language. This is NOT replacing spectre-mode!
  It merely handles spice extensions parsed by the spectre simulator spice
  compatibility parser.

+ added some hspice analysis and general keywords 

+ double quoted (") words in comments now highlight

+ also highlight e+-?? constructs in numbers (in same font as scale factors)

+ improved scale factor regexp for highlighting

+ changed spice formats to spice standard 

Release 1.2.22 (16 March 2003)
==============

+ \n keeps causing problems. Changed it to a punctuation character in the
  syntax table. Hope this is a good choice ...

+ added extra keywords to hspice options and draccdl device paramters

+ changed comment and doc regexps slightly. Docs can be nested in comments 
  now, as in eldo-mode

+ quoted (') words in comments and docs now highlight

+ scale factors highlight in constant face, seems a more appropriate face

+ added a test netlist to the distribution, should catch stupid mistakes

+ cleaned up doc string of spice-mode somewhat

Release 1.2.21 (26 February 2003)
==============

+ added font-lock expression for standard spice scale factors. Could be 
  considered overkill... Only highlights the scale factor part, this might
  be annoying. Anyways, easily removed if not wanted

+ Added C-cC-f shortcut key in Xemacs for running font-lock-fontify-buffer

+ modified syntax table: \n is no comment ender anymore. This confused 
  font-lock in some situations. Making \n (or ^J) a standard newline 
  (whitespace) character fixes these problems

+ fixed bug for non-file buffers in spice-mode. Probably nobody ever does this,
  but in Xemacs it makes the menu crash because spice-output-file-p assumes
  spice-output-filename works even if buffer-file-name is nil

+ added font-lock-set-defaults. Seems to be required, font-lock then
  initializes more reliably

Release 1.2.19 (26 December 2002)
==============

+ added local variable spice-tempo-tags (Manu suggested this) to store tempo
  abbrev's in. Add them to tempo-tags instead of tempo-local-tags.

+ added extra submode to Eldo: Eldo Verilog-A (EldoVlogA)

+ added submode to Layla: Mondriaan syntax extensions

+ added DracCDL mode. Syntax extensions used by Cadence' Dracula LOGLVS product

+ since so many submodes with dependencies, added a check if setup is OK with
  function spice-check-spice-standard

+ changed spice-model-name regexp to accept more model names

+ added verilog A include names to spice-library-regexp-start

+ added extra spice-eldo-keywords, introduced spice-eldo-colon-keywords,
  spice-eldo-macromodel-keywords, spice-eldovloga-keywords, 
  spice-eldovloga-colon-keywords, spice-mondriaan-keywords, 
  spice-draccdl-keywords, spice-eldo-types, spice-eldo-vloga-model-type-names,
  spice-draccdl-device-keywords, spice-draccdl-device-parameters,
  spice-mondriaan-entity-start-keywords, spice-draccdl-entity-start-keywords

+ added new face to handle builtins: spice-builtin-face

+ fixed problem with font-lock function matchers. xemacs only moves to the end
  of the reported match, which introduced endless CPU loops. Function matchers
  now at least move one position forward, functions: spice-match-variable-name,
  spice-match-eldo-colon-keywords. 

+ experimented with a xinstance function matcher. It would more easily handle
  all correct xinstance cases (like unlimited number of comment lines), but
  is much slower than a regexp. So stayed with "buggy" regexp for now. 

+ eldo: now handle labels with "'s and without "'s separately

+ eldo: handle builtin y macro's and user y models separately

+ spaces are now allowed in front of .option statements

+ highlight embedded changelog entries as in change-log-mode

+ tab (\t) now calls tempo-complete-tag, shift tab indent-for-tab-command

+ updated settling macro (thanx Manu)

+ added Manu's Digital and Mixed-signal eldo macro's. Also in menu.

+ added Spice Formats menu entry in Customize menu

+ updated mode description to reflect user visible defaults changes

+ cleaned up various comment strings, removed unused/obsolete code, 
  reformated code, added documentation strings, renamed various functions,
  etc.

Release 1.2.11 (7 August 2002)
==============

+ set font-lock-multiline variable to t. Helps avoid recoloring problems
  in multi line font-lock regexps

+ fixed bugs in include file module

+ added FastHenry submode

+ added hspice FEM Raphael constructs to hspice submode

Release 1.2.8 (15 April 2002)
=============

+ adapted spice-xinstance-regexp slightly to better match xinstances. 
  Tried to font-lock xinstances using matcher function instead of regexps.
  Is still not 100% reliable, so still prefering (safe) regexps. Changed
  matcher number of xinstance regexp throughout code.

+ replaced assoc by assoc-ignore-case in .subckt searching. Spice is case
  insensitive ! (Thanx Manu)

Release 1.2.7 (11 April 2002)
=============

+ First of all: major sync-up with eldo-mode:
  Modified spice-mode-name to be more in sync with eldo-mode
  Modified spice-eldo-keywords, spice-eldo-analyses, added keywords found 
  in eldo-mode
  Changed foreground color of spice-model-name-face to Red3, same as eldo-mode
  Modified spice-xinstance-regexp and spice-model-name-regexp to be more
  in sync with eldo-mode
  Changed spice-mode-map, added key bindings for tempo completion and comment
  hiding/unhiding. Other bindings are not always compatible between spice-
  and eldo-mode
  Adapted tempo templates to have easy tags for completion mostly abbrev cmp.
  Changed gain margin extraction macro taken from eldo-mode
  Added settling time macro, also taken from eldo-mode
  Extended a lot of templates, code copied from eldo-mode
  Added comment bar in menu, as in eldo-mode
  Added new templates in eldo macromodels submenu (copied from eldo-mode)
  Added nobound_phase to default options of empty eldo files

+ changed syntax of newline to comment ender. Removes \n from \\s- category,
  this caused problems with font-locking

+ Always display .subckt in other window, even if in current file. Seems 
  better user interface.

+ Finally solved recalculation of imenu. Set imenu--index-alist to nil and
  recalculate with imenu--make-index-alist.

+ Added tempo-complete-tag explanation in mode description. Left Abbrev mode
  in for now, so two alternatives for template completion exist now.

+ miscellaneous typing error corrections.

Release 1.2.6 (9 April 2002)
=============

+ added url link in spice customization group

+ actually use spice-custom-set to avoid ugly "Activate Customization in
  buffer" trick to apply user's customizations when spice-mode is already
  in use

+ added Netlist and Main Circuit headings to spice-section-alist, changed
  type of extra switches to sexp, and automatically apply customization to the
  menu's of existing spice-mode buffers

+ changed name of spice-output-filenames-alist to spice-output-filename-alist

+ removed buffer local spice-standard-local var. Use global spice-standard
  var everywhere. This means, all spice-mode buffers have the same standard's
  setting. Earlier, different buffers could have different settings of spice-
  standard, this is however incompatible with automatic activation of 
  user's customization in existing spice-mode buffers

+ added eldo-mode constructs ".subckt lib" and ".model lib" to library regexp.
  Don't know if anyone ever uses them...

+ added "macro" keyword to spice2g6, "subdup" keyword to eldo, "msgnode" 
  option parameter to eldo, "macro" to entity start spice2g6 keywords, removed
  "subckt" keyword from layla entity start list

+ renamed spice-words-init to spice-kywords-init, which is clearer describing
  what it does.

+ applied downcase to heading strings where appropriate. Seems the only way
  to make section code behave in a case insensitive way. 

+ adapted font-lock initialization of .subckt and .model handling to include
  new eldo constructs .model lib and .subckt lib. Also applied the same
  changes to imenu initialization

+ split off spice-output mode to become a more independent mode: added
  spice-output-mode-map (empty for now...), spice-output-menu-list for
  a separate output-mode menu, imenu-generic-expression is different, etc.

+ split off menu code in three functions: spice menu, spice-output menu
  and common menu code

+ added spice-menu-init function initializing both spice-menu-list and 
  spice-output-menu-list, changed spice-update-mode-menu to only install
  the global menu lists in a buffer, not recreate them from scratch

+ changed customization submenu. Removed "Activate..." function since it
  is no longer needed, added faces and section customization. These are most
  useful for typical users

+ clarified global versus buffer local, required for automatic customization
  support. Some global variables are not yet reinitialized. Still TODO

+ wrapped ffap-at-mouse in spice-load-file-at-mouse. Added 
  substitute-in-file-name to be able to handle environment variables in
  library names

+ Modified mode-map initialization as explained in info pages: make
  creation atomic with a setq. 

+ adapted spice-load-include-files to also handle recursive loading, and made
  recursive loading the default.

+ cleaned up various comment strings, removed unused/obsolete code, 
  reformated code, added documentation strings, renamed various functions,
  etc.


Release 1.2 (27 March 2002)
===========

+ changed maintainer string to include Emmanuel Rouat

+ fixed a bug in `spice-colorize-libraries', by saving the match data (done
  with a save-match-data form), a search-replace on the included file name
  now works. This bug was caused by having nested search functions destroying
  the saved match data. 

+ removed bogus save-match-data calls in fast font-lock matcher functions
  `spice-match-variable-name' and `spice-match-eldo-colon-keywords'.
  Only now really understand what save-match-data is about, see previous
  bug fix ;)

+ fixed a bug in `spice-font-lock-keywords-1', using regexp-opt-depth instead
  of fixed numbers. 

+ fixed a bug in `spice-uncomment-region', should work now for multi-level
  comments (more than one '*'). Fix taken from cc-mode.

+ added output spice-mode handling for eldo output files (.chi) and hspice 
  output files (.spout). When loading from input deck buffer a number of 
  extensions are tried, as is specified in the `spice-output-filenames-alist'
  list. Included this feature in the mode description.

+ added msb fix as in cperl-mode.el: if using msb, add a Spice decks category

+ added Eldo-RF support: keywords highlighting, sources, ...

+ added `spice-match-string-no-properties' compatibility layer function for 
  xemacs/emacs differences handling.

+ fixed a bug in detecting when a speedbar is alive, to correctly display the
  state in the Speedbar setting menu entry.

+ fixed numerous typing errors.

+ improved submode dependent menu activation

+ added fft analysis to hspice submode

+ added `spice-compile' wrapper function around compile function to
  handle simulator name correctly when renaming a buffer and then
  simulating it. Also replaced the menu entry in the Simulate menu.

+ modified `spice-set-simulator-command' to handle file-less buffers, and
  also (by using the spice-compile wrapper) recalculate the simulator command
  every time a simulation is started. This solves problems when decks are
  renamed and subsequently simulated.

+ removed obsolete `spice-comment-uncomment-region' function.

+ removed useless :initialize tags (lambda spice-custom-set functions) in
  many defcustoms

+ added automatic initialization of empty spice decks as per eldo-mode, with
  an extra: you can specify an init function to do everything yourself. 
  Completely customizable (`spice-initialize-empty-file', 
  `spice-initialize-file', `spice-initialize-template-file', 
  `spice-default-header', `spice-initialize-file-function'). 
  Compatibility with eldo-mode.

+ added waveform viewer interface. Beta for now, implementation may change!
  So beware when customizing these variables and upgrading later on. Also
  added menu entry Waveform viewer, which is largely a copy of Simulate.
  Waveform viewer available now include Nutmeg, Gwave, Xelga and
  Awaves (check the comment in the spice-mode.el for awaves, it requires a
  fix to the awaves script to work correctly).

+ added miscellaneous key bindings for: running a waveform viewer, loading the
  output file, loading all included files, (un)commenting regions, deleting
  of indentation, etc.

+ added a spice-library extent to the library links to distinguish them from
  other extents in the buffer.

+ refined the error message of `spice-load-file-at-mouse' when trying to load
  a non-readable file.

+ refined the changelog entries to be identifiable/distinguishable from really
  commented out sections of the files. Changelog is documentation, not 
  comment ! This is used by the comment region hiding/unhiding functionality.

+ added templates for layla devices: resistor, capacitor, inductor, diode and
  mosfet. Also added abbrevs for these devices (using the 'l' letter) and
  menu entries.

+ made menu sensitivity in general more accurate by checking for buffers that
  are readonly...

+ added menu entries in Edit submenu: fill paragraph, join line, load included
  or lib files, load output file, create .guess/nodeset file, replace with 
  .guess/nodeset statements, hide/unhide commented regions.

+ moved `spice-update-mode-menu' function into the menu section.

+ modified the syntax entries of ?\n, ?\", ?< and ?>. Avoided problems with
  font-locking by specifying that a ?\" is not a string delimiter there.

+ fixed `spice-mode-map' creation as explained in major mode info file

+ refined emacs/xemacs handling in pushing the mark after a search command in
  `spice-visit-subckt-def'.

+ added `spice-load-include-files' which loads all files that are included in
  the current deck. Use this to quickly load all files related to the current
  simulation job.

+ added hiding/unhiding of commented out regions. This code is also beta, the
  functionality or interface might change/be removed etc. 

+ adapted `set-spice-name' to include extra functionality in the mode line
  (output file mode, comment hiding).

+ added `spice-comment-indent-new-line' function to handle context
  sensitive prefix setting in auto-fill mode.

+ added Index menu to menubar in spice-mode. Controlled by a customization
  variable.

+ Show describe mode on first use of spice-mode. Controlled by a customization
  variable. Not trying to nag the user, but maybe it does ?

+ cleaned up the lisp/string formatting at various places in the code.


Release 1.0 (9 May 2001)
