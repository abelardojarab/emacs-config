BUGS
====

- Coloring is incomplete and sometimes wrong ...
  * Especially when typing in multi-line spice constructs. This is
    primarily a font-lock limitation. New fix `multi-line' option.
  * first line is always a title line, which is not true for included files
    Hard to solve: when is a file a top-level deck, when is it an included
    file ? 
  * using multiple submodes (hspice/eldo/layla) has incompatibilities for
    coloring. Set the submodes to the smallest possible set you want to use.
  * if you still find wrong fontification, send me an email. If
    possible with the spice construct that causes the problem. Or try to
    fix it yourself and send a patch with a short explanation ;)

- searching for subckt definitions can give wrong results if not started
  from top-level .cir file. Same problem as item #2 in coloring. Could
  try a `project' like approach. But who'll use it ?

- using hspice, eldo, eldorf and layla submodes at the same time is buggy 
  due to incompatibilities of the simulators/tools. 

- the Spice Menu is slow at first usage, don't know why. Has improved
  in Emacs21, I suggest an emacs upgrade if you find this a problem.

- loading of included files relies on imenu not truncating filenames.
  Preferrably set `imenu-max-item-length' to Unlimited.

- (XEmacs only): include and lib file highlighting is buggy when editing the
  line

- (Emacs21.2): when byte-compiling following errors/warnings occur, these are 
  OK:

While compiling the end of the data:
