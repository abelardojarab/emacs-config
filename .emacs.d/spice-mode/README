CREDITS
=======

The original spice-mode.el created by C. Vieri has been modified
extensively. These changes have been heavily influenced by the eldo-mode.el
of Emmanuel Rouat (the tempo-templates for one) and the vhdl-mode.el of
Reto Zimmermann and Rodney J. Whitby (the font-locking, the
customization, the menus, ...) Help in understanding 'advanced' lisp 
was provide by G. Debyser <geert.debyser@advalvas.be>, our (common) lisp
expert. Since version 0.97 a lot of input/ideas have been provided by
Emmanuel Rouat. Just take a look and search for eldo-mode throughout
the spice-mode.el file ;) The test_netlist.cir file has been created by
Manu and modified by Geert. 

The AUTHORS file contains the full names of the authors and their email
addresses.
