# Eshell fringe status indicators

Show an indicator of the status of the last command run in eshell. To
use, enable `eshell-fringe-status-mode` in `eshell-mode`. The easiest
way to do this is by adding a hook:

    (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook 'eshell-fringe-status-mode)

This mode was inspired by the status indicators of
[Final Term](https://github.com/p-e-w/finalterm).

Some extra fringe bitmaps are provided. In case you prefer either or
both of them over the default arrow bitmap. These are
`efs-plus-bitmap` and `efs-minus-bitmap`. These show a `+` and `-` in
the fringe respectively, instead of an arrow. These can be used by
setting the `eshell-fringe-status-success-bitmap` and the
`eshell-fringe-status-failure-bitmap` options.

*Note*: This mode uses a rather hackish way to try and keep everything
working in regard to `eshell-prompt-regexp`, so if anything breaks
please let me know.
