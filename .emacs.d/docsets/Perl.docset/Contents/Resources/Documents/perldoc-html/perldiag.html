<p>perldiag - various Perl diagnostics</p>
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    (W) A warning (optional).</li><li>    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).</li><li>    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).</li><li>    (F) A fatal error (trappable).</li><li>    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).</li><li>    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).</li><li>    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</li></ol></pre><p>The majority of messages from the first three classifications above
(W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma.</p>
<p>If a message can be controlled by the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.  E.g. <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">W</span> <span class="w">closed</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 means a warning in the <code class="inline"><span class="w">closed</span></code>
 category.</p>
<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma or the <b>-w</b>
and <b>-W</b> switches.  Warnings may be captured by setting <code class="inline"><span class="i">$SIG</span>{<span class="w">__WARN__</span>}</code>

to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a>.</p>
<p>Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled
with the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma or the <b>-X</b> switch.</p>
<p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
<a href="functions/eval.html">eval</a>.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma.
See <a href="warnings.html">warnings</a>.</p>
<p>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are
denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are
ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than
letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
letter.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="accept()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><b>accept() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="functions/accept.html">accept</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Aliasing-via-reference-is-experimental"></a><b>Aliasing via reference is experimental</b>
<p>(S experimental::refaliasing) This warning is emitted if you use
a reference constructor on the left-hand side of an assignment to
alias one variable to another.  Simply suppress the warning if you
want to use the feature, but know that in doing so you are taking
the risk of using an experimental feature which may change or be
removed in a future Perl version:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&quot;experimental::refaliasing&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">feature</span> <span class="q">&quot;refaliasing&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    \<span class="i">$x</span> = \<span class="i">$y</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre></li>
<li><a name="Allocation-too-large%3a-%25x"></a><b>Allocation too large: %x</b>
<p>(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'%25c'-allowed-only-after-types-%25s-in-%25s"></a><b>'%c' allowed only after types %s in %s</b>
<p>(F) The modifiers '!', '&lt;' and '&gt;' are allowed in pack() or unpack() only
after certain types.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Ambiguous-call-resolved-as-CORE%3a%3a%25s()%2c-qualify-as-such-or-use-%26"></a><b>Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</b>
<p>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling
one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.</p>
<p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's
imported with the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">subs</span></code>
 pragma).</p>
<p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <code class="inline"><span class="w">CORE::</span></code>
 prefix
on the operator (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="i">CORE::log</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$x</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
) or declare the subroutine
to be an object method (see <a href="perlsub.html#Subroutine-Attributes">Subroutine Attributes in perlsub</a> or
<a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>).</p>

<li><a name="Ambiguous-range-in-transliteration-operator"></a><b>Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</b>
<p>(F) You wrote something like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr/a-z-0//</a></code> which doesn't mean anything at
all.  To include a <code class="inline">-</code>
 character in a transliteration, put it either
first or last.  (In the past, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr/a-z-0//</a></code> was synonymous with
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr/a-y//</a></code>, which was probably not what you would have expected.)</p>

<p>(S ambiguous) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</p>

<li><a name="Ambiguous-use-of--%25s-resolved-as--%26%25s()"></a><b>Ambiguous use of -%s resolved as -&amp;%s()</b>
<p>(S ambiguous) You wrote something like <code class="inline">-<span class="w">foo</span></code>
, which might be the
string <code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;-foo&quot;</span></code>
, or a call to the function <code class="inline"><span class="w">foo</span></code>
, negated.  If you meant
the string, just write <code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;-foo&quot;</span></code>

, and <code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code>
 are both infix operators (modulus,

(denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something
like <code class="inline"><span class="i">*foo</span> * <span class="w">foo</span></code>
 that might be interpreted as either of them.  We
assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try to make it more
clear -- in the example given, you might write <code class="inline"><span class="i">*foo</span> * <span class="i">foo</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 if you
really meant to multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.</p>

<p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code class="inline"><span class="i">@</span>{<span class="w">foo</span>}</code>
, which might be
asking for the variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span></code>
, or it might be calling a function
named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference.  If you wanted
the variable, you can just write <code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span></code>
.  If you wanted to call the
function, write <code class="inline"><span class="i">@</span>{<span class="i">foo</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span>}</code>

 (where foo represents
the name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for element number
2 of the array named <code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span></code>
, in which case please write <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="n">2</span>]</code>
, or you
might have meant to pass an anonymous arrayref to the function named
foo, and then do a scalar deref on the value it returns.  If you meant
that, write <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span>{<span class="i">foo</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">]</span><span class="s">)</span>}</code>

<p>In regular expressions, the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span>{<span class="w">foo</span><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">]</span>}</code>
 syntax is sometimes necessary
to disambiguate between array subscripts and character classes.
<code class="inline"><span class="q">/$length[2345]/</span></code>
, for instance, will be interpreted as <code class="inline"><span class="i">$length</span></code>
 followed
by the character class <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">2345</span><span class="s">]</span></code>
.  If an array subscript is what you
want, you can avoid the warning by changing <code class="inline"><span class="q">/${length[2345]}/</span></code>
 to the
unsightly <code class="inline"><span class="q">/${\$length[2345]}/</span></code>

<p>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O

<p>(S internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to
see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.
This could indicate that SvREFCNT_dec() was called too many times, or
that SvREFCNT_inc() was called too few times, or that the SV was

<li><a name="Bareword-found-in-conditional"></a><b>Bareword found in conditional</b>
<p>(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part
of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a> <span class="w">FOO</span> || <a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as

</li>
<li><a name="Bareword-%22%25s%22-not-allowed-while-%22strict-subs%22-in-use"></a><b>Bareword "%s" not allowed while "strict subs" in use</b>
<p>(F) With "strict subs" in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the "=&gt;"
symbol.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bareword-%22%25s%22-refers-to-nonexistent-package"></a><b>Bareword "%s" refers to nonexistent package</b>
<p>(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form <code class="inline"><span class="w">Foo::</span></code>

you need to predeclare a package?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="BEGIN-failed--compilation-aborted"></a><b>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</b>
<p>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN
subroutine.  Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="BEGIN-not-safe-after-errors--compilation-aborted"></a><b>BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted</b>
<p>(F) Perl found a <code class="inline">BEGIN <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 subroutine (or a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code> directive, which
implies a <code class="inline">BEGIN <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
) after one or more compilation errors had already
occurred.  Since the intended environment for the <code class="inline">BEGIN <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 could not
be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely
depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%5c%25d-better-written-as-%24%25d"></a><b>\%d better written as $%d</b>
<p>(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.
The use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if
there are more than 9 backreferences.</p>

<p>In a bracketed character class in a regular expression pattern, you
had a range which has exactly one end of it specified using <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, and
the other end is specified using a non-portable mechanism.  Perl treats
the range as a Unicode range, that is, all the characters in it are
considered to be the Unicode characters, and which may be different code
points on some platforms Perl runs on.  For example, <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span>\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">06</span><span class="s">}</span>-\<span class="w">x08</span><span class="s">]</span></code>

is treated as if you had instead said <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span>\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">06</span><span class="s">}</span>-\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">08</span><span class="s">}</span><span class="s">]</span></code>
, that is it
matches the characters whose code points in Unicode are 6, 7, and 8.
But that <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x08</span></code>
 might indicate that you meant something different, so
the warning gets raised.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Buffer-overflow-in-prime_env_iter%3a-%25s"></a><b>Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s</b>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  While Perl was preparing to

exited by calling exit.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s()-called-too-early-to-check-prototype"></a><b>%s() called too early to check prototype</b>
<p>(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the
parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
that the call conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an
early prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype
checking.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the
function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid
the warning.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-compress-integer-in-pack"></a><b>Cannot compress integer in pack</b>
<p>(F) An argument to pack("w",...) was too large to compress.
The BER compressed integer format can only be used with positive
integers, and you attempted to compress a very large number (&gt; 1e308).
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-compress-negative-numbers-in-pack"></a><b>Cannot compress negative numbers in pack</b>

<li><a name="Cannot-convert-a-reference-to-%25s-to-typeglob"></a><b>Cannot convert a reference to %s to typeglob</b>
<p>(F) You manipulated Perl's symbol table directly, stored a reference
in it, then tried to access that symbol via conventional Perl syntax.
The access triggers Perl to autovivify that typeglob, but it there is
no legal conversion from that type of reference to a typeglob.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-copy-to-%25s"></a><b>Cannot copy to %s</b>

Perl code, but are only used internally.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can-only-compress-unsigned-integers-in-pack"></a><b>Can only compress unsigned integers in pack</b>
<p>(F) An argument to pack("w",...) was not an integer.  The BER compressed

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-bless-non-reference-value"></a><b>Can't bless non-reference value</b>

<li><a name="Can't-call-method-%22%25s%22-on-unblessed-reference"></a><b>Can't call method "%s" on unblessed reference</b>
<p>(F) A method call must know in what package it's supposed to run.  It
ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but you
didn't supply an object reference in this case.  A reference isn't an
object reference until it has been blessed.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>

<p>(F) You're on a system such as MS-DOS that gets confused if you try
reading from a deleted (but still opened) file.  You have to say
<code class="inline">-<span class="w">i</span>.<span class="w">bak</span></code>

<p>(W locale) You are 1) running under "<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span></code>
"; 2) the current
locale is not a UTF-8 one; 3) you tried to do the designated case-change
operation on the specified Unicode character; and 4) the result of this
operation would mix Unicode and locale rules, which likely conflict.
Mixing of different rule types is forbidden, so the operation was not
done; instead the result is the indicated value, which is the best
available that uses entirely Unicode rules.  That turns out to almost
always be the original character, unchanged.</p>
<p>It is generally a bad idea to mix non-UTF-8 locales and Unicode, and
this issue is one of the reasons why.  This warning is raised when
Unicode rules would normally cause the result of this operation to
contain a character that is in the range specified by the locale,
0..255, and hence is subject to the locale's rules, not Unicode's.</p>
<p>If you are using locale purely for its characteristics related to things
like its numeric and time formatting (and not <code class="inline"><span class="w">LC_CTYPE</span></code>
), consider
using a restricted form of the locale pragma (see <a href="perllocale.html#The-%22use-locale%22-pragma">The use locale pragma in perllocale</a>) like "<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span> <span class="q">&#39;:not_characters&#39;</span></code>
".</p>
<p>Note that failed case-changing operations done as a result of
case-insensitive <code class="inline">/i</code> regular expression matching will show up in this
warning as having the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/fc.html">fc</a></code> operation (as that is what the regular
expression engine calls behind the scenes.)</p>

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%25s-%25s-endian-%25ss-on-this-platform"></a><b>Can't %s %s-endian %ss on this platform</b>

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-exec-%22%25s%22%3a-%25s"></a><b>Can't exec "%s": %s</b>
<p>(W exec) A system(), exec(), or piped open call could not execute the

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-find-label-%25s"></a><b>Can't find label %s</b>
<p>(F) You said to goto a label that isn't mentioned anywhere that it's
possible for us to go to.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-find-%25s-on-PATH"></a><b>Can't find %s on PATH</b>
<p>(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not be
found in the PATH.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-find-%25s-on-PATH%2c-'.'-not-in-PATH"></a><b>Can't find %s on PATH, '.' not in PATH</b>
<p>(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not be
found in the PATH, or at least not with the correct permissions.  The
script exists in the current directory, but PATH prohibits running it.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-find-string-terminator-%25s-anywhere-before-EOF"></a><b>Can't find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF</b>
<p>(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines.  This message means
that the closing delimiter was omitted.  Because bracketed quotes count
nesting levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    print q(The character '(' starts a side comment.);</li></ol></pre><p>If you're getting this error from a here-document, you may have
included unseen whitespace before or after your closing tag or there
may not be a linebreak after it.  A good programmer's editor will have
a way to help you find these characters (or lack of characters).  See
<a href="perlop.html">perlop</a> for the full details on here-documents.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-find-Unicode-property-definition-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Can't find Unicode property definition "%s"</b>
<p>(F) You may have tried to use <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 which means a Unicode
property (for example <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Lu</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 matches all uppercase

<li><a name="Can't-fork%3a-%25s"></a><b>Can't fork: %s</b>
<p>(F) A fatal error occurred while trying to fork while opening a
pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-fork%2c-trying-again-in-5-seconds"></a><b>Can't fork, trying again in 5 seconds</b>
<p>(W pipe) A fork in a piped open failed with EAGAIN and will be retried
after five seconds.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-get-filespec---stale-stat-buffer%3f"></a><b>Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference
between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access-checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL stat() routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up
and returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access-checking
routine knows about the Perl <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/stat.html">stat</a></code> operator and file tests, so you
shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-get-pipe-mailbox-device-name"></a><b>Can't get pipe mailbox device name</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  After creating a mailbox to act as a
pipe, Perl can't retrieve its name for later use.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-get-SYSGEN-parameter-value-for-MAXBUF"></a><b>Can't get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl asked $GETSYI how big you want your
mailbox buffers to be, and didn't get an answer.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22goto%22-into-the-middle-of-a-foreach-loop"></a><b>Can't "goto" into the middle of a foreach loop</b>
<p>(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump into the middle of a foreach
loop.  You can't get there from here.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22goto%22-out-of-a-pseudo-block"></a><b>Can't "goto" out of a pseudo block</b>
<p>(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump out of what might look like
a block, except that it isn't a proper block.  This usually occurs if
you tried to jump out of a sort() block or subroutine, which is a no-no.
See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-goto-subroutine-from-an-eval-%25s"></a><b>Can't goto subroutine from an eval-%s</b>
<p>(F) The "goto subroutine" call can't be used to jump out of an eval
"string" or block.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-goto-subroutine-from-a-sort-sub-(or-similar-callback)"></a><b>Can't goto subroutine from a sort sub (or similar callback)</b>
<p>(F) The "goto subroutine" call can't be used to jump out of the
comparison sub for a sort(), or from a similar callback (such
as the reduce() function in List::Util).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-goto-subroutine-outside-a-subroutine"></a><b>Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine</b>
<p>(F) The deeply magical "goto subroutine" call can only replace one
subroutine call for another.  It can't manufacture one out of whole
cloth.  In general you should be calling it out of only an AUTOLOAD
routine anyway.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-ignore-signal-CHLD%2c-forcing-to-default"></a><b>Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</b>
<p>(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD
signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled.  Since disabling this
signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child
processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.  This
situation typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-kill-a-non-numeric-process-ID"></a><b>Can't kill a non-numeric process ID</b>
<p>(F) Process identifiers must be (signed) integers.  It is a fatal error to
attempt to kill() an undefined, empty-string or otherwise non-numeric
process identifier.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22last%22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><b>Can't "last" outside a loop block</b>
<p>(F) A "last" statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a current
block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't count as a "loopish"
block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or grep().  You can
usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the
inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.  See
<a href="functions/last.html">last</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-linearize-anonymous-symbol-table"></a><b>Can't linearize anonymous symbol table</b>
<p>(F) Perl tried to calculate the method resolution order (MRO) of a
package, but failed because the package stash has no name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-load-'%25s'-for-module-%25s"></a><b>Can't load '%s' for module %s</b>
<p>(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension.
This may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one
that is incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known
to happen between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your
dynamic extension was built against an older version of the library
that is installed on your system.  You may need to rebuild your old
dynamic extensions.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-localize-lexical-variable-%25s"></a><b>Can't localize lexical variable %s</b>
<p>(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously declared as a
lexical variable using "my" or "state".  This is not allowed.  If you
want to localize a package variable of the same name, qualify it with
the package name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-localize-through-a-reference"></a><b>Can't localize through a reference</b>
<p>(F) You said something like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/local.html">local</a> <span class="i">$$ref</span></code>
, which Perl can't currently
handle, because when it goes to restore the old value of whatever $ref
pointed to after the scope of the local() is finished, it can't be sure
that $ref will still be a reference.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-%25s"></a><b>Can't locate %s</b>
<p>(F) You said to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do.html">do</a></code> (or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code>, or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code>) a file that couldn't be found.
Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in @INC, unless
the file name included the full path to the file.  Perhaps you need
to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where the
extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name
to @INC.  Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the file.  See
<a href="functions/require.html">require</a> and <a href="lib.html">lib</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-auto%2f%25s.al-in-%40INC"></a><b>Can't locate auto/%s.al in @INC</b>
<p>(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which allows
autoload, but there is no function to autoload.  Most probable causes
are a misprint in a function/method name or a failure to <code class="inline"><span class="w">AutoSplit</span></code>

the file, say, by doing <code class="inline"><span class="w">make</span> <span class="w">install</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-loadable-object-for-module-%25s-in-%40INC"></a><b>Can't locate loadable object for module %s in @INC</b>
<p>(F) The module you loaded is trying to load an external library, like
for example, <i>foo.so</i> or <i>bar.dll</i>, but the <a href="DynaLoader.html">DynaLoader</a> module was
unable to locate this library.  See <a href="DynaLoader.html">DynaLoader</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-object-method-%22%25s%22-via-package-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Can't locate object method "%s" via package "%s"</b>
<p>(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define that particular
method, nor does any of its base classes.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-object-method-%22%25s%22-via-package-%22%25s%22-(perhaps-you-forgot-to-load-%22%25s%22%3f)"></a><b>Can't locate object method "%s" via package "%s" (perhaps you forgot
to load "%s"?)</b>
<p>(F) You called a method on a class that did not exist, and the method
could not be found in UNIVERSAL.  This often means that a method
requires a package that has not been loaded.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-package-%25s-for-%40%25s%3a%3aISA"></a><b>Can't locate package %s for @%s::ISA</b>
<p>(W syntax) The @ISA array contained the name of another package that
doesn't seem to exist.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-PerlIO%25s"></a><b>Can't locate PerlIO%s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to use in open() a PerlIO layer that does not exist,
e.g. open(FH, "&gt;:nosuchlayer", "somefile").</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-make-list-assignment-to-%25ENV-on-this-system"></a><b>Can't make list assignment to %ENV on this system</b>
<p>(F) List assignment to %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably
VMS.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-make-loaded-symbols-global-on-this-platform-while-loading-%25s"></a><b>Can't make loaded symbols global on this platform while loading %s</b>
<p>(S) A module passed the flag 0x01 to DynaLoader::dl_load_file() to request
that symbols from the stated file are made available globally within the
process, but that functionality is not available on this platform.  Whilst
the module likely will still work, this may prevent the perl interpreter
from loading other XS-based extensions which need to link directly to
functions defined in the C or XS code in the stated file.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-modify-%25s-in-%25s"></a><b>Can't modify %s in %s</b>
<p>(F) You aren't allowed to assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try
to change it, such as with an auto-increment.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-modify-nonexistent-substring"></a><b>Can't modify nonexistent substring</b>
<p>(P) The internal routine that does assignment to a substr() was handed
a NULL.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-modify-non-lvalue-subroutine-call"></a><b>Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call</b>
<p>(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as
such.  See <a href="perlsub.html#Lvalue-subroutines">Lvalue subroutines in perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-modify-reference-to-%25s-in-%25s-assignment"></a><b>Can't modify reference to %s in %s assignment</b>
<p>(F) Only a limited number of constructs can be used as the argument to a
reference constructor on the left-hand side of an assignment, and what
you used was not one of them.  See <a href="perlref.html#Assigning-to-References">Assigning to References in perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-modify-reference-to-localized-parenthesized-array-in-list-assignment"></a><b>Can't modify reference to localized parenthesized array in list

<p>(F) Assigning to <code class="inline">\<a class="l_k" href="functions/local.html">local</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">@array</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">\<span class="s">(</span><a class="l_k" href="functions/local.html">local</a> <span class="i">@array</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 is not supported, as
it is not clear exactly what it should do.  If you meant to make @array
refer to some other array, use <code class="inline">\<span class="i">@array</span> = \<span class="i">@other_array</span></code>
.  If you want to
make the elements of @array aliases of the scalars referenced on the
right-hand side, use <code class="inline">\<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">@array</span><span class="s">)</span> = <span class="i">@scalar_refs</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-modify-reference-to-parenthesized-hash-in-list-assignment"></a><b>Can't modify reference to parenthesized hash in list assignment</b>
<p>(F) Assigning to <code class="inline">\<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">%hash</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 is not supported.  If you meant to make %hash
refer to some other hash, use <code class="inline">\<span class="i">%hash</span> = \<span class="i">%other_hash</span></code>
.  If you want to
make the elements of %hash into aliases of the scalars referenced on the
right-hand side, use a hash slice: <code class="inline">\<span class="i">@hash</span>{<span class="i">@keys</span>} = <span class="i">@those_scalar_refs</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-msgrcv-to-read-only-var"></a><b>Can't msgrcv to read-only var</b>
<p>(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be used as a receive
buffer.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22next%22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><b>Can't "next" outside a loop block</b>
<p>(F) A "next" statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or
grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops
once.  See <a href="functions/next.html">next</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-%25s%3a-%25s"></a><b>Can't open %s: %s</b>
<p>(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of the <code class="inline">&lt;&gt;</code>

filehandle, either implicitly under the <code class="inline">-<span class="w">n</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">-p</code>
 command-line
switches, or explicitly, failed for the indicated reason.  Usually
this is because you don't have read permission for a file which
you named on the command line.</p>
<p>(F) You tried to call perl with the <b>-e</b> switch, but <i>/dev/null</i> (or
your operating system's equivalent) could not be opened.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-a-reference"></a><b>Can't open a reference</b>
<p>(W io) You tried to open a scalar reference for reading or writing,
using the 3-arg open() syntax:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a> <span class="w">FH</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&#39;&gt;&#39;</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$ref</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>but your version of perl is compiled without perlio, and this form of
open is not supported.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-bidirectional-pipe"></a><b>Can't open bidirectional pipe</b>
<p>(W pipe) You tried to say <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">CMD</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&quot;|cmd|&quot;</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, which is not supported.
You can try any of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such
as IPC::Open2.  Alternately, direct the pipe's output to a file using
"&gt;", and then read it in under a different file handle.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-error-file-%25s-as-stderr"></a><b>Can't open error file %s as stderr</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '2&gt;' or '2&gt;&gt;' on
the command line for writing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-input-file-%25s-as-stdin"></a><b>Can't open input file %s as stdin</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '&lt;' on the
command line for reading.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-output-file-%25s-as-stdout"></a><b>Can't open output file %s as stdout</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '&gt;' or '&gt;&gt;' on
the command line for writing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-output-pipe-(name%3a-%25s)"></a><b>Can't open output pipe (name: %s)</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the pipe into which to send data destined
for stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-perl-script-%22%25s%22%3a-%25s"></a><b>Can't open perl script "%s": %s</b>
<p>(F) The script you specified can't be opened for the indicated reason.</p>
<p>If you're debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies on the
shell's $PATH search, the -S option causes perl to do that search, so
you don't have to type the path or <code class="inline"><span class="q">`which $scriptname`</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-read-CRTL-environ"></a><b>Can't read CRTL environ</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read an element of %ENV
from the CRTL's internal environment array and discovered the array was
missing.  You need to figure out where your CRTL misplaced its environ
or define <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see <a href="perlvms.html">perlvms</a>) so that environ is not
searched.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22redo%22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><b>Can't "redo" outside a loop block</b>
<p>(F) A "redo" statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map()
or grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that
loops once.  See <a href="functions/redo.html">redo</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-remove-%25s%3a-%25s%2c-skipping-file"></a><b>Can't remove %s: %s, skipping file</b>
<p>(S inplace) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup
file.  Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace it with
the modified file.  The file was left unmodified.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-rename-%25s-to-%25s%3a-%25s%2c-skipping-file"></a><b>Can't rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file</b>
<p>(S inplace) The rename done by the <b>-i</b> switch failed for some reason,
probably because you don't have write permission to the directory.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-reopen-input-pipe-(name%3a-%25s)-in-binary-mode"></a><b>Can't reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried
to reopen it to accept binary data.  Alas, it failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-represent-character-for-Ox%25X-on-this-platform"></a><b>Can't represent character for Ox%X on this platform</b>
<p>(F) There is a hard limit to how big a character code point can be due
to the fundamental properties of UTF-8, especially on EBCDIC
platforms.  The given code point exceeds that.  The only work-around is
to not use such a large code point.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-reset-%25ENV-on-this-system"></a><b>Can't reset %ENV on this system</b>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/reset.html">reset('E')</a></code> or similar, which tried to reset
all variables in the current package beginning with "E".  In
the main package, that includes %ENV.  Resetting %ENV is not
supported on some systems, notably VMS.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-resolve-method-%22%25s%22-overloading-%22%25s%22-in-package-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Can't resolve method "%s" overloading "%s" in package "%s"</b>
<p>(F)(P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as
opposed to a subroutine reference): no such method callable via the
package.  If the method name is <code class="inline">???</code>, this is an internal error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-return-%25s-from-lvalue-subroutine"></a><b>Can't return %s from lvalue subroutine</b>
<p>(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as
temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue.  This
is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-return-outside-a-subroutine"></a><b>Can't return outside a subroutine</b>
<p>(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
there was no subroutine call to return out of.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-return-%25s-to-lvalue-scalar-context"></a><b>Can't return %s to lvalue scalar context</b>
<p>(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue
subroutine, but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl
think you meant to return only one value.  You probably meant to
write parentheses around the call to the subroutine, which tell
Perl that the call should be in list context.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-stat-script-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Can't stat script "%s"</b>
<p>(P) For some reason you can't fstat() the script even though you have it
open already.  Bizarre.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-take-log-of-%25g"></a><b>Can't take log of %g</b>
<p>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the logarithm of a
negative number or zero.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes
standard with Perl, though, if you really want to do that for the
negative numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-take-sqrt-of-%25g"></a><b>Can't take sqrt of %g</b>
<p>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the square root of a
negative number.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard
with Perl, though, if you really want to do that.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-undef-active-subroutine"></a><b>Can't undef active subroutine</b>
<p>(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running.  You can,
however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even undef the
redefined subroutine while the old routine is running.  Go figure.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-upgrade-%25s-(%25d)-to-%25d"></a><b>Can't upgrade %s (%d) to %d</b>
<p>(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds "members" to an SV, making it
into a more specialized kind of SV.  The top several SV types are so
specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.  This message
indicates that such a conversion was attempted.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-'%25c'-after--mname"></a><b>Can't use '%c' after -mname</b>
<p>(F) You tried to call perl with the <b>-m</b> switch, but you put something
other than "=" after the module name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-a-hash-as-a-reference"></a><b>Can't use a hash as a reference</b>
<p>(F) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in
<code class="inline"><span class="i">%foo</span>-&gt;{<span class="q">&quot;bar&quot;</span>}</code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="i">%$ref</span>-&gt;{<span class="q">&quot;hello&quot;</span>}</code>
.  Versions of perl
&lt;= 5.22.0 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't
have.  This was deprecated in perl 5.6.1.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-an-array-as-a-reference"></a><b>Can't use an array as a reference</b>
<p>(F) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in
<code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span>-&gt;[<span class="n">23</span>]</code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="i">@$ref</span>-&gt;[<span class="n">99</span>]</code>
.  Versions of perl &lt;= 5.22.0
used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't have.  This
was deprecated in perl 5.6.1.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-anonymous-symbol-table-for-method-lookup"></a><b>Can't use anonymous symbol table for method lookup</b>
<p>(F) The internal routine that does method lookup was handed a symbol
table that doesn't have a name.  Symbol tables can become anonymous
for example by undefining stashes: <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a> <span class="i">%Some::Package::</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-an-undefined-value-as-%25s-reference"></a><b>Can't use an undefined value as %s reference</b>
<p>(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
be a defined value.  This helps to delurk some insidious errors.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-bareword-(%22%25s%22)-as-%25s-ref-while-%22strict-refs%22-in-use"></a><b>Can't use bareword ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use</b>
<p>(F) Only hard references are allowed by "strict refs".  Symbolic
references are disallowed.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-%25!-because-Errno.pm-is-not-available"></a><b>Can't use %! because Errno.pm is not available</b>
<p>(F) The first time the <code class="inline"><span class="i">%!</span></code>
 hash is used, perl automatically loads the
Errno.pm module.  The Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to
provide symbolic names for <code class="inline"><span class="i">$!</span></code>
 errno values.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-both-'%3c'-and-'%3e'-after-type-'%25c'-in-%25s"></a><b>Can't use both '&lt;' and '&gt;' after type '%c' in %s</b>
<p>(F) A type cannot be forced to have both big-endian and little-endian
byte-order at the same time, so this combination of modifiers is not
allowed.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-'defined(%40array)'-(Maybe-you-should-just-omit-the-defined()%3f)"></a><b>Can't use 'defined(@array)' (Maybe you should just omit the defined()?)</b>
<p>(F) defined() is not useful on arrays because it
checks for an undefined <i>scalar</i> value.  If you want to see if the
array is empty, just use <code class="inline">if (@array) { # not empty }</code> for example.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-'defined(%25hash)'-(Maybe-you-should-just-omit-the-defined()%3f)"></a><b>Can't use 'defined(%hash)' (Maybe you should just omit the defined()?)</b>
<p>(F) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined()</a></code> is not usually right on hashes.</p>
<p>Although <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined</a> <span class="i">%hash</span></code>
 is false on a plain not-yet-used hash, it
becomes true in several non-obvious circumstances, including iterators,
weak references, stash names, even remaining true after <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a> <span class="i">%hash</span></code>
.
These things make <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined</a> <span class="i">%hash</span></code>
 fairly useless in practice, so it now
generates a fatal error.</p>
<p>If a check for non-empty is what you wanted then just put it in boolean
context (see <a href="perldata.html#Scalar-values">Scalar values in perldata</a>):</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/if.html">if</a> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">%hash</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span></li><li>       <span class="c"># not empty</span></li><li>    <span class="s">}</span></li></ol></pre><p>If you had <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined</a> <span class="i">%Foo::Bar::QUUX</span></code>
 to check whether such a package

a good way to enquire about the features of a package, or whether
it's loaded, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-%25s-for-loop-variable"></a><b>Can't use %s for loop variable</b>
<p>(P) The parser got confused when trying to parse a <code class="inline">foreach</code>
 loop.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-global-%25s-in-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Can't use global %s in "%s"</b>
<p>(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This
is not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location
(namely the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to
have variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
weren't.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-'%25c'-in-a-group-with-different-byte-order-in-%25s"></a><b>Can't use '%c' in a group with different byte-order in %s</b>
<p>(F) You attempted to force a different byte-order on a type
that is already inside a group with a byte-order modifier.
For example you cannot force little-endianness on a type that
is inside a big-endian group.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-%22my-%25s%22-in-sort-comparison"></a><b>Can't use "my %s" in sort comparison</b>
<p>(F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort comparisons.
You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator,
and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
lexical variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-%25s-ref-as-%25s-ref"></a><b>Can't use %s ref as %s ref</b>
<p>(F) You've mixed up your reference types.  You have to dereference a
reference of the type needed.  You can use the ref() function to
test the type of the reference, if need be.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-string-(%22%25s%22)-as-%25s-ref-while-%22strict-refs%22-in-use"></a><b>Can't use string ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use</b>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-string-(%22%25s%22...)-as-%25s-ref-while-%22strict-refs%22-in-use"></a><b>Can't use string ("%s"...) as %s ref while "strict refs" in use</b>
<p>(F) You've told Perl to dereference a string, something which
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">strict</span></code>
 blocks to prevent it happening accidentally.  See
<a href="perlref.html#Symbolic-references">Symbolic references in perlref</a>.  This can be triggered by an <code class="inline"><span class="i">@</span></code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span></code>

in a double-quoted string immediately before interpolating a variable,
for example in <code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;user @$twitter_id&quot;</span></code>
, which says to treat the contents
of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$twitter_id</span></code>
 as an array reference; use a <code class="inline">\</code>
 to have a literal <code class="inline"><span class="i">@</span></code>

symbol followed by the contents of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$twitter_id</span></code>
: <code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;user \@$twitter_id&quot;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-subscript-on-%25s"></a><b>Can't use subscript on %s</b>
<p>(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a
subscript.  But to the left of the brackets was an expression that
didn't look like a hash or array reference, or anything else subscriptable.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-%5c%25c-to-mean-%24%25c-in-expression"></a><b>Can't use \%c to mean $%c in expression</b>
<p>(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that
creates a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a
backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular
expression pattern.  Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a
value that prints out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf).  Use the $1 form
instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-weaken-a-nonreference"></a><b>Can't weaken a nonreference</b>
<p>(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference.  Only
references can be weakened.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22when%22-outside-a-topicalizer"></a><b>Can't "when" outside a topicalizer</b>
<p>(F) You have used a when() block that is neither inside a <code class="inline">foreach</code>

loop nor a <code class="inline">given</code>
 block.  (Note that this error is issued on exit
from the <code class="inline">when</code>
 block, so you won't get the error if the match fails,
or if you use an explicit <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue.html">continue</a></code>.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-x%3d-to-read-only-value"></a><b>Can't x= to read-only value</b>
<p>(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value)
with an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself.
Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Character-following-%22%5cc%22-must-be-printable-ASCII"></a><b>Character following "\c" must be printable ASCII</b>
<p>(F) In <code class="inline">\c<i>X</i></code>, <i>X</i> must be a printable (non-control) ASCII character.</p>
<p>Note that ASCII characters that don't map to control characters are
discouraged, and will generate the warning (when enabled)

<p>(D deprecated, regexp) The \C character class is deprecated, and will
become a compile-time error in a future release of perl (tentatively
v5.24).  This construct allows you to match a single byte of what makes
up a multi-byte single UTF8 character, and breaks encapsulation.  It is
currently also very buggy.  If you really need to process the individual
bytes, you probably want to convert your string to one where each
underlying byte is stored as a character, with utf8::encode().</p>

</li>
<li><a name="Constant-is-not-%25s-reference"></a><b>Constant is not %s reference</b>
<p>(F) A constant value (perhaps declared using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">constant</span></code>
 pragma)
is being dereferenced, but it amounts to the wrong type of reference.
The message indicates the type of reference that was expected.  This
usually indicates a syntax error in dereferencing the constant value.
See <a href="perlsub.html#Constant-Functions">Constant Functions in perlsub</a> and <a href="constant.html">constant</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Constants-from-lexical-variables-potentially-modified-elsewhere-are-deprecated"></a><b>Constants from lexical variables potentially modified elsewhere are
deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You wrote something like</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$var</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <span class="i">$sub</span> = <span class="i">sub ()</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$var</span> <span class="s">}</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>but $var is referenced elsewhere and could be modified after the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a></code>
expression is evaluated.  Either it is explicitly modified elsewhere
(<code class="inline"><span class="i">$var</span> = <span class="n">3</span></code>
) or it is passed to a subroutine or to an operator like
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/printf.html">printf</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/map.html">map</a></code>, which may or may not modify the variable.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Perl has captured the value of the variable at that
point and turned the subroutine into a constant eligible for inlining.
In those cases where the variable can be modified elsewhere, this
breaks the behavior of closures, in which the subroutine captures
the variable itself, rather than its value, so future changes to the
variable are reflected in the subroutine's return value.</p>
<p>This usage is deprecated, because the behavior is likely to change
in a future version of Perl.</p>
<p>If you intended for the subroutine to be eligible for inlining, then
make sure the variable is not referenced elsewhere, possibly by
copying it:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$var2</span> = <span class="i">$var</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <span class="i">$sub</span> = <span class="i">sub ()</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$var2</span> <span class="s">}</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>If you do want this subroutine to be a closure that reflects future
changes to the variable that it closes over, add an explicit <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/return.html">return</a></code>:</p>

</li>
<li><a name="%3aconst-is-not-permitted-on-named-subroutines"></a><b>:const is not permitted on named subroutines</b>
<p>(F) The "const" attribute causes an anonymous subroutine to be run and

</li>
<li><a name="delete-argument-is-index%2fvalue-array-slice%2c-use-array-slice"></a><b>delete argument is index/value array slice, use array slice</b>

<p>(F) In a here document construct like <code class="inline">&lt;&lt;FOO</code>, the label <code class="inline"><span class="w">FOO</span></code>

that triggers this error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Deprecated-use-of-my()-in-false-conditional"></a><b>Deprecated use of my() in false conditional</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You used a declaration similar to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$x</span> if <span class="n">0</span></code>
.  There
has been a long-standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical variable
not to be cleared at scope exit when its declaration includes a false
conditional.  Some people have exploited this bug to achieve a kind of
static variable.  Since we intend to fix this bug, we don't want people
relying on this behavior.  You can achieve a similar static effect by
declaring the variable in a separate block outside the function, eg</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li><a name="f"></a>    sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$x</span> if <span class="n">0</span><span class="sc">;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/return.html">return</a> <span class="i">$x</span>++ <span class="s">}</span></li></ol></pre><p>becomes</p>

<li><a name="DESTROY-created-new-reference-to-dead-object-'%25s'"></a><b>DESTROY created new reference to dead object '%s'</b>
<p>(F) A DESTROY() method created a new reference to the object which is
just being DESTROYed.  Perl is confused, and prefers to abort rather
than to create a dangling reference.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Did-not-produce-a-valid-header"></a><b>Did not produce a valid header</b>
<p>See Server error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-did-not-return-a-true-value"></a><b>%s did not return a true value</b>
<p>(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that
it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It's
traditional to end such a file with a "1;", though any true value would
do.  See <a href="functions/require.html">require</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Did-you-mean-%26%25s-instead%3f)"></a><b>(Did you mean &amp;%s instead?)</b>
<p>(W misc) You probably referred to an imported subroutine &amp;FOO as $FOO or
some such.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Did-you-mean-%22local%22-instead-of-%22our%22%3f)"></a><b>(Did you mean "local" instead of "our"?)</b>
<p>(W misc) Remember that "our" does not localize the declared global
variable.  You have declared it again in the same lexical scope, which
seems superfluous.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Did-you-mean-%24-or-%40-instead-of-%25%3f)"></a><b>(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)</b>
<p>(W) You probably said %hash{$key} when you meant $hash{$key} or
@hash{@keys}.  On the other hand, maybe you just meant %hash and got
carried away.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Died"></a><b>Died</b>
<p>(F) You passed die() an empty string (the equivalent of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a> <span class="q">&quot;&quot;</span></code>
) or
you called it with no args and <code class="inline"><span class="i">$@</span></code>
 was empty.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Document-contains-no-data"></a><b>Document contains no data</b>
<p>See Server error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-does-not-define-%25s%3a%3aVERSION--version-check-failed"></a><b>%s does not define %s::VERSION--version check failed</b>
<p>(F) You said something like "use Module 42" but the Module did not

</li>
<li><a name="'%2f'-does-not-take-a-repeat-count"></a><b>'/' does not take a repeat count</b>
<p>(F) You cannot put a repeat count of any kind right after the '/' code.
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Don't-know-how-to-get-file-name"></a><b>Don't know how to get file name</b>
<p>(P) <code class="inline"><span class="w">PerlIO_getname</span></code>

somehow called on another platform.  This should not happen.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Don't-know-how-to-handle-magic-of-type-%5c%25o"></a><b>Don't know how to handle magic of type \%o</b>
<p>(P) The internal handling of magical variables has been cursed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="do_study%3a-out-of-memory"></a><b>do_study: out of memory</b>
<p>(P) This should have been caught by safemalloc() instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Do-you-need-to-predeclare-%25s%3f)"></a><b>(Do you need to predeclare %s?)</b>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
"%s found where operator expected".  It often means a subroutine or module
name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet.  This may be
because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
"sub", "package", "require", or "use" statement.  If you're referencing
something that isn't defined yet, you don't actually have to define the
subroutine or package before the current location.  You can use an empty
"sub foo;" or "package FOO;" to enter a "forward" declaration.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="dump()-better-written-as-CORE%3a%3adump()"></a><b>dump() better written as CORE::dump()</b>
<p>(W misc) You used the obsolescent <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/dump.html">dump()</a></code> built-in function, without fully
qualifying it as <code class="inline"><span class="i">CORE::dump</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
.  Maybe it's a typo.  See <a href="functions/dump.html">dump</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="dump-is-not-supported"></a><b>dump is not supported</b>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't support dump/undump.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Duplicate-free()-ignored"></a><b>Duplicate free() ignored</b>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something that had
already been freed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Duplicate-modifier-'%25c'-after-'%25c'-in-%25s"></a><b>Duplicate modifier '%c' after '%c' in %s</b>
<p>(W unpack) You have applied the same modifier more than once after a
type in a pack template.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="each-on-reference-is-experimental"></a><b>each on reference is experimental</b>
<p>(S experimental::autoderef) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/each.html">each</a></code> with a scalar argument is experimental

<li><a name="elseif-should-be-elsif"></a><b>elseif should be elsif</b>
<p>(S syntax) There is no keyword "elseif" in Perl because Larry thinks
it's ugly.  Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method
named "elseif" for the class returned by the following block.  This is
unlikely to be what you want.</p>
</li>

 are used to introduce a named Unicode property, as
described in <a href="perlunicode.html">perlunicode</a> and <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.  You used <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span></code>

a regular expression without specifying the property name.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><a name="%25ENV-is-aliased-to-%25s"></a><b>%ENV is aliased to %s</b>
<p>(F) You're running under taint mode, and the <code class="inline"><span class="i">%ENV</span></code>
 variable has been
aliased to another hash, so it doesn't reflect anymore the state of the
program's environment.  This is potentially insecure.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Error-converting-file-specification-%25s"></a><b>Error converting file specification %s</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Because Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts them to a
single form when it must operate on them directly.  Either you've passed
an invalid file specification to Perl, or you've found a case the
conversion routines don't handle.  Drat.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Eval-group-in-insecure-regular-expression"></a><b>Eval-group in insecure regular expression</b>
<p>(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular

<p>(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the
<code class="inline">(?{ ... })</code> zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the
pattern contains interpolated values.  Since that is a security risk,
it is not allowed.  If you insist, you may still do this by using the
<code class="inline"><span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">&#39;eval&#39;</span></code>
 pragma or by explicitly building the pattern from an
interpolated string at run time and using that in an eval().  See
<a href="perlre.html#(%3f%7b-code-%7d)">(?{ code }) in perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Eval-group-not-allowed%2c-use-re-'eval'-in-regex-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval' in regex m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) A regular expression contained the <code class="inline">(?{ ... })</code> zero-width

<p>(F) You used a pattern that nested too many EVAL calls without consuming
any text.  Restructure the pattern so that text is consumed.</p>
<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was
discovered.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Excessively-long-%3c%3e-operator"></a><b>Excessively long &lt;&gt; operator</b>
<p>(F) The contents of a &lt;&gt; operator may not exceed the maximum size of a
Perl identifier.  If you're just trying to glob a long list of

<li><a name="Explicit-blessing-to-''-(assuming-package-main)"></a><b>Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)</b>
<p>(W misc) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string.  This has
the effect of blessing the reference into the package main.  This is
usually not what you want.  Consider providing a default target package,
e.g. bless($ref, $p || 'MyPackage');</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s%3a-Expression-syntax"></a><b>%s: Expression syntax</b>

<p>(W regexp)(F) A character class range must start and end at a literal
character, not another character class like <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">[:alpha:]</code>.  The "-"
in your false range is interpreted as a literal "-".  In a <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?[...])</span></code>

the "-", "\-".  The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression
the problem was discovered.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Fatal-VMS-error-(status%3d%25d)-at-%25s%2c-line-%25d"></a><b>Fatal VMS error (status=%d) at %s, line %d</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Something untoward happened in a VMS
system service or RTL routine; Perl's exit status should provide more
details.  The filename in "at %s" and the line number in "line %d" tell
you which section of the Perl source code is distressed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="fcntl-is-not-implemented"></a><b>fcntl is not implemented</b>
<p>(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement fcntl().  What is this, a
PDP-11 or something?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="FETCHSIZE-returned-a-negative-value"></a><b>FETCHSIZE returned a negative value</b>
<p>(F) A tied array claimed to have a negative number of elements, which
is not possible.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Field-too-wide-in-'u'-format-in-pack"></a><b>Field too wide in 'u' format in pack</b>
<p>(W pack) Each line in an uuencoded string starts with a length indicator
which can't encode values above 63.  So there is no point in asking for
a line length bigger than that.  Perl will behave as if you specified
<code class="inline"><span class="w">u63</span></code>
 as the format.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Filehandle-%25s-opened-only-for-input"></a><b>Filehandle %s opened only for input</b>
<p>(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle.  If you intended
it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with "+&lt;" or
"+&gt;" or "+&gt;&gt;" instead of with "&lt;" or nothing.  If you intended only to
write the file, use "&gt;" or "&gt;&gt;".  See <a href="functions/open.html">open</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Filehandle-%25s-opened-only-for-output"></a><b>Filehandle %s opened only for output</b>
<p>(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing, If
you intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it
with "+&lt;" or "+&gt;" or "+&gt;&gt;" instead of with "&gt;".  If you intended only to
read from the file, use "&lt;".  See <a href="functions/open.html">open</a>.  Another possibility
is that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0 (also known as STDIN) for
output (maybe you closed STDIN earlier?).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Filehandle-%25s-reopened-as-%25s-only-for-input"></a><b>Filehandle %s reopened as %s only for input</b>
<p>(W io) You opened for reading a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as STDOUT or STDERR.  This occurred because you closed STDOUT or STDERR
previously.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Filehandle-STDIN-reopened-as-%25s-only-for-output"></a><b>Filehandle STDIN reopened as %s only for output</b>
<p>(W io) You opened for writing a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as STDIN.  This occurred because you closed STDIN previously.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Final-%24-should-be-%5c%24-or-%24name"></a><b>Final $ should be \$ or $name</b>
<p>(F) You must now decide whether the final $ in a string was meant to be
a literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name that
happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or the
name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="flock()-on-closed-filehandle-%25s"></a><b>flock() on closed filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you're attempting to flock() got itself closed
some time before now.  Check your control flow.  flock() operates on
filehandles.  Are you attempting to call flock() on a dirhandle by the
same name?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Format-not-terminated"></a><b>Format not terminated</b>
<p>(F) A format must be terminated by a line with a solitary dot.  Perl got
to the end of your file without finding such a line.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Format-%25s-redefined"></a><b>Format %s redefined</b>
<p>(W redefine) You redefined a format.  To suppress this warning, say</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="s">{</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;redefine&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">&quot;format NAME =...&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <span class="s">}</span></li></ol></pre></li>

</li>
<li><a name="%25s-found-where-operator-expected"></a><b>%s found where operator expected</b>
<p>(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.
If it sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an
operator, it gives you this warning.  Usually it indicates that an
operator or delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="gdbm-store-returned-%25d%2c-errno-%25d%2c-key-%22%25s%22"></a><b>gdbm store returned %d, errno %d, key "%s"</b>
<p>(S) A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="gethostent-not-implemented"></a><b>gethostent not implemented</b>
<p>(F) Your C library apparently doesn't implement gethostent(), probably
because if it did, it'd feel morally obligated to return every hostname
on the Internet.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="get%25sname()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><b>get%sname() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to get a socket or peer socket name on a closed
socket.  Did you forget to check the return value of your socket() call?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="getpwnam-returned-invalid-UIC-%25%23o-for-user-%22%25s%22"></a><b>getpwnam returned invalid UIC %#o for user "%s"</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  The call to <code class="inline"><span class="w">sys</span><span class="i">$getuai</span></code>
 underlying the
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/getpwnam.html">getpwnam</a></code> operator returned an invalid UIC.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="getsockopt()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><b>getsockopt() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to get a socket option on a closed socket.  Did you
forget to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="functions/getsockopt.html">getsockopt</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="given-is-experimental"></a><b>given is experimental</b>
<p>(S experimental::smartmatch) <code class="inline">given</code>
 depends on smartmatch, which
is experimental, so its behavior may change or even be removed
in any future release of perl.  See the explanation under
<a href="perlsyn.html#Experimental-Details-on-given-and-when">Experimental Details on given and when in perlsyn</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Global-symbol-%22%25s%22-requires-explicit-package-name-(did-you-forget-to-declare-%22my-%25s%22%3f)"></a><b>Global symbol "%s" requires explicit package name (did you forget to
declare "my %s"?)</b>
<p>(F) You've said "use strict" or "use strict vars", which indicates 
that all variables must either be lexically scoped (using "my" or "state"), 
declared beforehand using "our", or explicitly qualified to say 
which package the global variable is in (using "::").</p>
</li>
<li><a name="glob-failed-(%25s)"></a><b>glob failed (%s)</b>
<p>(S glob) Something went wrong with the external program(s) used
for <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/glob.html">glob</a></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="q">&lt;*.c&gt;</span></code>
.  Usually, this means that you supplied a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/glob.html">glob</a></code>
pattern that caused the external program to fail and exit with a
nonzero status.  If the message indicates that the abnormal exit
resulted in a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell)
is broken.  If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables
in config.sh:  If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as
if it were csh (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="w">full_csh</span>=<span class="q">&#39;/usr/bin/tcsh&#39;</span></code>
); otherwise, make them
all empty (except that <code class="inline"><span class="w">d_csh</span></code>
 should be <code class="inline"><span class="q">&#39;undef&#39;</span></code>
) so that Perl will
think csh is missing.  In either case, after editing config.sh, run
<code class="inline">./Configure -S</code> and rebuild Perl.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Glob-not-terminated"></a><b>Glob not terminated</b>
<p>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a "less than".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="gmtime(%25f)-failed"></a><b>gmtime(%f) failed</b>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> with a number that it could not handle:
too large, too small, or NaN.  The returned value is <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a></code>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="gmtime(%25f)-too-large"></a><b>gmtime(%f) too large</b>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> with a number that was larger than
it can reliably handle and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> probably returned the wrong
date.  This warning is also triggered with NaN (the special
not-a-number value).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="gmtime(%25f)-too-small"></a><b>gmtime(%f) too small</b>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> with a number that was smaller than
it can reliably handle and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> probably returned the wrong date.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Got-an-error-from-DosAllocMem"></a><b>Got an error from DosAllocMem</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to OS/2.  Most probably you're using an obsolete
version of Perl, and this should not happen anyway.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="goto-must-have-label"></a><b>goto must have label</b>
<p>(F) Unlike with "next" or "last", you're not allowed to goto an
unspecified destination.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Goto-undefined-subroutine%25s"></a><b>Goto undefined subroutine%s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to call a subroutine with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto.html">goto</a> <span class="i">&amp;sub</span></code>
 syntax, but
the indicated subroutine hasn't been defined, or if it was, it
has since been undefined.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Group-name-must-start-with-a-non-digit-word-character-in-regex%3b-marked-by--%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>Group name must start with a non-digit word character in regex; marked by 
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) Group names must follow the rules for perl identifiers, meaning
they must start with a non-digit word character.  A common cause of
this error is using (?&amp;0) instead of (?0).  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="()-group-starts-with-a-count"></a><b>()-group starts with a count</b>
<p>(F) A ()-group started with a count.  A count is supposed to follow
something: a template character or a ()-group.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-had-compilation-errors."></a><b>%s had compilation errors.</b>
<p>(F) The final summary message when a <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -c</code>

</li>
<li><a name="Had-to-create-%25s-unexpectedly"></a><b>Had to create %s unexpectedly</b>
<p>(S internal) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought
to have existed already, but for some reason it didn't, and had to be
created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-has-too-many-errors"></a><b>%s has too many errors</b>
<p>(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
Further error messages would likely be uninformative.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Having-more-than-one-%2f%25c-regexp-modifier-is-deprecated"></a><b>Having more than one /%c regexp modifier is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated, regexp) You used the indicated regular expression pattern
modifier at least twice in a string of modifiers.  It is deprecated to
do this with this particular modifier, to allow future extensions to the
Perl language.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Hexadecimal-float%3a-exponent-overflow"></a><b>Hexadecimal float: exponent overflow</b>
<p>(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point has a larger exponent
than the floating point supports.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Hexadecimal-float%3a-exponent-underflow"></a><b>Hexadecimal float: exponent underflow</b>
<p>(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point has a smaller exponent
than the floating point supports.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Hexadecimal-float%3a-internal-error"></a><b>Hexadecimal float: internal error</b>
<p>(F) Something went horribly bad in hexadecimal float handling.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Hexadecimal-float%3a-mantissa-overflow"></a><b>Hexadecimal float: mantissa overflow</b>
<p>(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point literal had more bits in
the mantissa (the part between the 0x and the exponent, also known as
the fraction or the significand) than the floating point supports.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Hexadecimal-float%3a-precision-loss"></a><b>Hexadecimal float: precision loss</b>
<p>(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point had internally more
digits than could be output.  This can be caused by unsupported
long double formats, or by 64-bit integers not being available
(needed to retrieve the digits under some configurations).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Hexadecimal-float%3a-unsupported-long-double-format"></a><b>Hexadecimal float: unsupported long double format</b>
<p>(F) You have configured Perl to use long doubles but
the internals of the long double format are unknown;
therefore the hexadecimal float output is impossible.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Hexadecimal-number-%3e-0xffffffff-non-portable"></a><b>Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable</b>
<p>(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more on portability concerns.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Identifier-too-long"></a><b>Identifier too long</b>
<p>(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to
about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
names (like <code class="inline"><span class="i">$A::B</span></code>
).  You've exceeded Perl's limits.  Future versions
of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Ignoring-zero-length-%5cN%7b%7d-in-character-class-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>Ignoring zero length \N{} in character class in regex; marked by

<p>(W regexp) Named Unicode character escapes (<code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
) may return a
zero-length sequence.  When such an escape is used in a character
class its behavior is not well defined.  Check that the correct
escape has been used, and the correct charname handler is in scope.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-binary-digit-%25s"></a><b>Illegal binary digit %s</b>
<p>(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-binary-digit-%25s-ignored"></a><b>Illegal binary digit %s ignored</b>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a
binary number.  Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the
offending digit.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-character-after-'_'-in-prototype-for-%25s-%3a-%25s"></a><b>Illegal character after '_' in prototype for %s : %s</b>
<p>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype
declaration.  The '_' in a prototype must be followed by a ';',
indicating the rest of the parameters are optional, or one of '@'
or '%', since those two will accept 0 or more final parameters.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-character-%5c%25o-(carriage-return)"></a><b>Illegal character \%o (carriage return)</b>
<p>(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it
would any other whitespace, which means you should never see this error
when Perl was built using standard options.  For some reason, your
version of Perl appears to have been built without this support.  Talk
to your Perl administrator.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-character-in-prototype-for-%25s-%3a-%25s"></a><b>Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s</b>
<p>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype declaration.
Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, \, and +.
Perhaps you were trying to write a subroutine signature but didn't enable
that feature first (<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">feature</span> <span class="q">&#39;signatures&#39;</span></code>
), so your signature was
instead interpreted as a bad prototype.</p>
</li>

<p>(F) When using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a></code> keyword to construct an anonymous subroutine,
you must always specify a block of code.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>

<li><a name="Illegal-division-by-zero"></a><b>Illegal division by zero</b>
<p>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in

meaningless input.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-hexadecimal-digit-%25s-ignored"></a><b>Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored</b>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or
A - F, a - f in a hexadecimal number.  Interpretation of the hexadecimal
number stopped before the illegal character.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-modulus-zero"></a><b>Illegal modulus zero</b>
<p>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0 to get the remainder.  Most
numbers don't take to this kindly.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-number-of-bits-in-vec"></a><b>Illegal number of bits in vec</b>
<p>(F) The number of bits in vec() (the third argument) must be a power of

</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-octal-digit-%25s"></a><b>Illegal octal digit %s</b>
<p>(F) You used an 8 or 9 in an octal number.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><a name="Ill-formed-message-in-prime_env_iter%3a-%7c%25s%7c"></a><b>Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</b>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read a logical

didn't see the expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was
ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(in-cleanup)-%25s"></a><b>(in cleanup) %s</b>
<p>(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a DESTROY() method raised
the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by the
system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number of
times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that
would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.</p>
<p>Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">G_KEEPERR</span></code>

integers for your architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Integer-overflow-in-%25s-number"></a><b>Integer overflow in %s number</b>
<p>(S overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified
either as a literal or as an argument to hex() or oct() is too big for
your architecture, and has been converted to a floating point number.
On a 32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl
transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation
internally--subject to loss of precision errors in subsequent
operations.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Integer-overflow-in-srand"></a><b>Integer overflow in srand</b>
<p>(S overflow) The number you have passed to srand is too big to fit
in your architecture's integer representation.  The number has been
replaced with the largest integer supported (0xFFFFFFFF on 32-bit
architectures).  This means you may be getting less randomness than
you expect, because different random seeds above the maximum will
return the same sequence of random numbers.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><a name="Integer-overflow-in-version-%25d"></a><b>Integer overflow in version %d</b>
<p>(W overflow) Some portion of a version initialization is too large for
the size of integers for your architecture.  This is not a warning
because there is no rational reason for a version to try and use an
element larger than typically 2**32.  This is usually caused by trying
to use some odd mathematical operation as a version, like 100/9.</p>

you've called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/fork.html">fork</a></code> and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code>, to determine whether the current call
to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> should affect the current script or a subprocess (see
<a href="perlvms.html#exec-LIST">exec LIST in perlvms</a>).  Somehow, this count has become scrambled, so
Perl is making a guess and treating this <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> as a request to
terminate the Perl script and execute the specified command.</p>

A "lax" version number is a positive decimal number (integer or
decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal
v-string.  If the v-string has fewer than three components, it
must have a leading 'v' character.  Otherwise, the leading 'v' is
optional.  Both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a
trailing "alpha" component separated by an underscore character
after a fractional or dotted-decimal component.  The parenthesized
text indicates which criteria were not met.  See the <a href="version.html">version</a> module
for more details on allowed version formats.</p>

<p>(W locale) You are using the named locale, which is a non-UTF-8 one, and
which perl has determined is not fully compatible with what it can
handle.  The second <code class="inline"><span class="i">%s</span></code>
 gives a reason.</p>
<p>By far the most common reason is that the locale has characters in it
that are represented by more than one byte.  The only such locales that
Perl can handle are the UTF-8 locales.  Most likely the specified locale
is a non-UTF-8 one for an East Asian language such as Chinese or
Japanese.  If the locale is a superset of ASCII, the ASCII portion of it
may work in Perl.</p>
<p>Some essentially obsolete locales that aren't supersets of ASCII, mainly
those in ISO 646 or other 7-bit locales, such as ASMO 449, can also have
problems, depending on what portions of the ASCII character set get
changed by the locale and are also used by the program.
The warning message lists the determinable conflicting characters.</p>
<p>Note that not all incompatibilities are found.</p>
<p>If this happens to you, there's not much you can do except switch to use a
different locale or use <a href="Encode.html">Encode</a> to translate from the locale into
UTF-8; if that's impracticable, you have been warned that some things
may break.</p>
<p>This message is output once each time a bad locale is switched into
within the scope of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span></code>

<p>(W imprecision) The value you attempted to increment or decrement by one
is too large for the underlying floating point representation to store
accurately, hence the target of <code class="inline">++</code>

warning because it has already switched from integers to floating point
when values are too large for integers, and now even floating point is
insufficient.  You may wish to switch to using <a href="Math/BigInt.html">Math::BigInt</a> explicitly.</p>

</li>
<li><a name="Malformed-prototype-for-%25s%3a-%25s"></a><b>Malformed prototype for %s: %s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to use a function with a malformed prototype.  The
syntax of function prototypes is given a brief compile-time check for
obvious errors like invalid characters.  A more rigorous check is run
when the function is called.
Perhaps the function's author was trying to write a subroutine signature
but didn't enable that feature first (<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">feature</span> <span class="q">&#39;signatures&#39;</span></code>

<p>One possible cause is that you set the UTF8 flag yourself for data that

doing it Perl met a malformed Unicode surrogate.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Mandatory-parameter-follows-optional-parameter"></a><b>Mandatory parameter follows optional parameter</b>
<p>(F) In a subroutine signature, you wrote something like "$a = undef,
$b", making an earlier parameter optional and a later one mandatory.
Parameters are filled from left to right, so it's impossible for the
caller to omit an earlier one and pass a later one.  If you want to act
as if the parameters are filled from right to left, declare the rightmost
optional and then shuffle the parameters around in the subroutine's body.</p>

<p>(S non_unicode) Perl allows strings to contain a superset of
Unicode code points; each code point may be as large as what is storable
in an unsigned integer on your system, but these may not be accepted by
other languages/systems.  This message occurs when you matched a string
containing such a code point against a regular expression pattern, and
the code point was matched against a Unicode property, <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
 or
<code class="inline">\<span class="i">P</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
.  Unicode properties are only defined on Unicode code points,
so the result of this match is undefined by Unicode, but Perl (starting
in v5.20) treats non-Unicode code points as if they were typical
unassigned Unicode ones, and matched this one accordingly.  Whether a
given property matches these code points or not is specified in
<a href="perluniprops.html#Properties-accessible-through-%5cp%7b%7d-and-%5cP%7b%7d">Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{} in perluniprops</a>.</p>
<p>This message is suppressed (unless it has been made fatal) if it is
immaterial to the results of the match if the code point is Unicode or
not.  For example, the property <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">ASCII_Hex_Digit</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 only can match
the 22 characters <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">0</span>-<span class="n">9</span><span class="w">A</span>-<span class="w">Fa</span>-f<span class="s">]</span></code>
, so obviously all other code points,
Unicode or not, won't match it.  (And <code class="inline">\<span class="i">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">ASCII_Hex_Digit</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 will match
every code point except these 22.)</p>
<p>Getting this message indicates that the outcome of the match arguably
should have been the opposite of what actually happened.  If you think
that is the case, you may wish to make the <code class="inline"><span class="w">non_unicode</span></code>
 warnings
category fatal; if you agree with Perl's decision, you may wish to turn
off this category.</p>

<p>(F) Perl aborted due to too high a number of signals pending.  This

<li><a name="Missing-right-brace-on-%5cN%7b%7d-or-unescaped-left-brace-after-%5cN"></a><b>Missing right brace on \N{} or unescaped left brace after \N</b>
<p>(F) <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 has two meanings.</p>
<p>The traditional one has it followed by a name enclosed in braces,
meaning the character (or sequence of characters) given by that
name.  Thus <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">ASTERISK</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 is another way of writing <code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code>
, valid in both
double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns.  In patterns,
it doesn't have the meaning an unescaped <code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code>
 does.</p>
<p>Starting in Perl 5.12.0, <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 also can have an additional meaning (only)
in patterns, namely to match a non-newline character.  (This is short
for <code class="inline">[^\n]</code>, and like <code class="inline">.</code> but is not affected by the <code class="inline">/s</code> regex modifier.)</p>
<p>This can lead to some ambiguities.  When <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 is not followed immediately
by a left brace, Perl assumes the <code class="inline">[^\n]</code> meaning.  Also, if the braces
form a valid quantifier such as <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">5</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, Perl assumes that this
means to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples,
3; and 5 or more, respectively).  In all other case, where there is a
<code class="inline">\N{</code> and a matching <code class="inline">}</code>, Perl assumes that a character name is desired.</p>
<p>However, if there is no matching <code class="inline">}</code>, Perl doesn't know if it was
mistakenly omitted, or if <code class="inline">[^\n]{</code> was desired, and raises this error.
If you meant the former, add the right brace; if you meant the latter,
escape the brace with a backslash, like so: <code class="inline">\N\{</code></p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-right-curly-or-square-bracket"></a><b>Missing right curly or square bracket</b>
<p>(F) The lexer counted more opening curly or square brackets than closing
ones.  As a general rule, you'll find it's missing near the place you
were last editing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Missing-semicolon-on-previous-line%3f)"></a><b>(Missing semicolon on previous line?)</b>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
"%s found where operator expected".  Don't automatically put a semicolon on
the previous line just because you saw this message.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Modification-of-a-read-only-value-attempted"></a><b>Modification of a read-only value attempted</b>
<p>(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a
constant.  You didn't, of course, try "2 = 1", because the compiler
catches that.  But an easy way to do the same thing is:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li><a name="mod"></a>    sub <span class="m">mod</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$_</span>[<span class="n">0</span>] = <span class="n">1</span> <span class="s">}</span></li><li>    <span class="i">mod</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>Another way is to assign to a substr() that's off the end of the string.</p>
<p>Yet another way is to assign to a <code class="inline">foreach</code>

is aliased to a constant in the look <i>LIST</i>:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$x</span> = <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/foreach.html">foreach</a> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$n</span> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$x</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span></li><li>        <span class="i">$n</span> *= <span class="n">2</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="c"># modifies the $x, but fails on attempt to</span></li><li>    <span class="s">}</span>            <span class="c"># modify the 2</span></li></ol></pre></li>

backwards.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Modification-of-non-creatable-hash-value-attempted%2c-%25s"></a><b>Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted, %s</b>

</li>
<li><a name="Module-name-required-with--%25c-option"></a><b>Module name required with -%c option</b>
<p>(F) The <code class="inline">-M</code>

you omitted the name of the module.  Consult <a href="perlrun.html">perlrun</a> for full details
about <code class="inline">-M</code>
 and <code class="inline">-m</code>.</p>

mathematically logical behavior for what matches when inverting
is very different from what people expect, so we have decided to
forbid it.  Similarly unclear is what should be generated when the

<li><a name="%5cN%7bNAME%7d-must-be-resolved-by-the-lexer-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>\N{NAME} must be resolved by the lexer in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) When compiling a regex pattern, an unresolved named character or
sequence was encountered.  This can happen in any of several ways that
bypass the lexer, such as using single-quotish context, or an extra
backslash in double-quotish:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">&#39;\N{SPACE}&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># Wrong!</span></li><li>    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">&quot;\\N{SPACE}&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># Wrong!</span></li><li>    <span class="q">/$re/</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>Instead, use double-quotes with a single backslash:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">&quot;\N{SPACE}&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># ok</span></li><li>    <span class="q">/$re/</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>The lexer can be bypassed as well by creating the pattern from smaller
components:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">&#39;\N&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <span class="q">/${re}{SPACE}/</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># Wrong!</span></li></ol></pre><p>It's not a good idea to split a construct in the middle like this, and
it doesn't work here.  Instead use the solution above.</p>
<p>Finally, the message also can happen under the <code class="inline">/x</code> regex modifier when the
<code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 is separated by spaces from the <code class="inline">{</code>, in which case, remove the spaces.</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="q">/\N {SPACE}/x</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># Wrong!</span></li><li>    <span class="q">/\N{SPACE}/x</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># ok</span></li></ol></pre></li>
<li><a name="No-%25s-allowed-while-running-setuid"></a><b>No %s allowed while running setuid</b>
<p>(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or
setgid script to even be allowed to attempt.  Generally speaking there
will be another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least
securable.  See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="NO-BREAK-SPACE-in-a-charnames-alias-definition-is-deprecated"></a><b>NO-BREAK SPACE in a charnames alias definition is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You defined a character name which contained a no-break
space character.  Change it to a regular space.  Usually these names are
defined in the <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">alias</span></code>
 import argument to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">charnames</span></code>

<a href="charnames.html#CUSTOM-ALIASES">CUSTOM ALIASES in charnames</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-code-specified-for--%25c"></a><b>No code specified for -%c</b>
<p>(F) Perl's <b>-e</b> and <b>-E</b> command-line options require an argument.  If
you want to run an empty program, pass the empty string as a separate
argument or run a program consisting of a single 0 or 1:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="w">perl</span> -e <span class="q">&quot;&quot;</span></li><li>    <span class="w">perl</span> -<span class="w">e0</span></li><li>    <span class="w">perl</span> -<span class="w">e1</span></li></ol></pre></li>
<li><a name="No-comma-allowed-after-%25s"></a><b>No comma allowed after %s</b>
<p>(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or "indirect object" is
not allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments.
Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.</p>
<p>One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported
a constant to your name space with <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> while no such
importing took place, it may for example be that your operating
system does not support that particular constant.  Hopefully you did
use an explicit import list for the constants you expect to see;
please see <a href="functions/use.html">use</a> and <a href="functions/import.html">import</a>.  While an
explicit import list would probably have caught this error earlier
it naturally does not remedy the fact that your operating system
still does not support that constant.  Maybe you have a typo in
the constants of the symbol import list of <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> or in the
constant name at the line where this error was triggered?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-command-into-which-to-pipe-on-command-line"></a><b>No command into which to pipe on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '|' at the end of the command line, so it
doesn't know where you want to pipe the output from this command.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-DB%3a%3aDB-routine-defined"></a><b>No DB::DB routine defined</b>
<p>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <b>-d</b> switch, but
for some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a <code class="inline"><span class="w">Devel::</span></code>

module) didn't define a routine to be called at the beginning of each
statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-dbm-on-this-machine"></a><b>No dbm on this machine</b>
<p>(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every machine should
supply dbm nowadays, because Perl comes with SDBM.  See <a href="SDBM_File.html">SDBM_File</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-DB%3a%3asub-routine-defined"></a><b>No DB::sub routine defined</b>
<p>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <b>-d</b> switch, but

of each ordinary subroutine call.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-directory-specified-for--I"></a><b>No directory specified for -I</b>
<p>(F) The <b>-I</b> command-line switch requires a directory name as part of the

</li>
<li><a name="No-error-file-after-2%3e-or-2%3e%3e-on-command-line"></a><b>No error file after 2&gt; or 2&gt;&gt; on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line

find the name of the file to which to write data destined for stderr.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-group-ending-character-'%25c'-found-in-template"></a><b>No group ending character '%c' found in template</b>

</li>
<li><a name="No-output-file-after-%3e-on-command-line"></a><b>No output file after &gt; on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line

</li>
<li><a name="No-Perl-script-found-in-input"></a><b>No Perl script found in input</b>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -x</code>

</li>
<li><a name="No-such-hook%3a-%25s"></a><b>No such hook: %s</b>
<p>(F) You specified a signal hook that was not recognized by Perl.
Currently, Perl accepts <code class="inline"><span class="w">__DIE__</span></code>

</li>
<li><a name="No-such-pipe-open"></a><b>No such pipe open</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  The internal routine my_pclose() tried to
close a pipe which hadn't been opened.  This should have been caught
earlier as an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-such-signal%3a-SIG%25s"></a><b>No such signal: SIG%s</b>
<p>(W signal) You specified a signal name as a subscript to %SIG that was
not recognized.  Say <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/kill.html">kill</a> -l</code>
 in your shell to see the valid signal

</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-CODE-reference"></a><b>Not a CODE reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can
use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See
also <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-GLOB-reference"></a><b>Not a GLOB reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a "typeglob" (that is, a
symbol table entry that looks like <code class="inline"><span class="i">*foo</span></code>
), but found a reference to
something else instead.  You can use the ref() function to find out what
kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-HASH-reference"></a><b>Not a HASH reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a hash value, but found a

</li>
<li><a name="Not-an-ARRAY-reference"></a><b>Not an ARRAY reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to an array value, but found
a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref() function
to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-an-unblessed-ARRAY-reference"></a><b>Not an unblessed ARRAY reference</b>
<p>(F) You passed a reference to a blessed array to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/push.html">push</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/shift.html">shift</a></code> or
another array function.  These only accept unblessed array references

</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-SCALAR-reference"></a><b>Not a SCALAR reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a scalar value, but found

to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-subroutine-reference"></a><b>Not a subroutine reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a

</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-subroutine-reference-in-overload-table"></a><b>Not a subroutine reference in overload table</b>
<p>(F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an overloading table that
doesn't somehow point to a valid subroutine.  See <a href="overload.html">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-enough-arguments-for-%25s"></a><b>Not enough arguments for %s</b>
<p>(F) The function requires more arguments than you specified.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-enough-format-arguments"></a><b>Not enough format arguments</b>
<p>(W syntax) A format specified more picture fields than the next line
supplied.  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>

<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>
</li>

 or with
an <code class="inline"><span class="q">/l</span></code>
 regular expression modifier, as that would require deferring
to run-time the calculation of what it should evaluate to, and it is
regex compile-time only.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="no-UTC-offset-information%3b-assuming-local-time-is-UTC"></a><b>no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl was unable to find the local
timezone offset, so it's assuming that local system time is equivalent
to UTC.  If it's not, define the logical name
<i>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</i> to translate to the number of seconds which
need to be added to UTC to get local time.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="NULL-OP-IN-RUN"></a><b>NULL OP IN RUN</b>
<p>(S debugging) Some internal routine called run() with a null opcode
pointer.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Null-picture-in-formline"></a><b>Null picture in formline</b>
<p>(F) The first argument to formline must be a valid format picture
specification.  It was found to be empty, which probably means you
supplied it an uninitialized value.  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Null-realloc"></a><b>Null realloc</b>
<p>(P) An attempt was made to realloc NULL.</p>

<p>(P) The internal pattern matching routines blew it big time.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="NULL-regexp-parameter"></a><b>NULL regexp parameter</b>
<p>(P) The internal pattern matching routines are out of their gourd.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Number-too-long"></a><b>Number too long</b>
<p>(F) Perl limits the representation of decimal numbers in programs to
about 250 characters.  You've exceeded that length.  Future
versions of Perl are likely to eliminate this arbitrary limitation.  In
the meantime, try using scientific notation (e.g. "1e6" instead of
"1_000_000").</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Number-with-no-digits"></a><b>Number with no digits</b>
<p>(F) Perl was looking for a number but found nothing that looked like
a number.  This happens, for example with <code class="inline">\<span class="w">o</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, with no number between
the braces.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Octal-number-%3e-037777777777-non-portable"></a><b>Octal number &gt; 037777777777 non-portable</b>
<p>(W portable) The octal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more on portability concerns.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Odd-name%2fvalue-argument-for-subroutine"></a><b>Odd name/value argument for subroutine</b>
<p>(F) A subroutine using a slurpy hash parameter in its signature
received an odd number of arguments to populate the hash.  It requires
the arguments to be paired, with the same number of keys as values.
The caller of the subroutine is presumably at fault.  Inconveniently,
this error will be reported at the location of the subroutine, not that
of the caller.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Odd-number-of-arguments-for-overload%3a%3aconstant"></a><b>Odd number of arguments for overload::constant</b>
<p>(W overload) The call to overload::constant contained an odd number of
arguments.  The arguments should come in pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Odd-number-of-elements-in-anonymous-hash"></a><b>Odd number of elements in anonymous hash</b>
<p>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Odd-number-of-elements-in-hash-assignment"></a><b>Odd number of elements in hash assignment</b>
<p>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Offset-outside-string"></a><b>Offset outside string</b>
<p>(F)(W layer) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv/seek operation
with an offset pointing outside the buffer.  This is difficult to
imagine.  The sole exceptions to this are that zero padding will
take place when going past the end of the string when either
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sysread.html">sysread()</a></code>ing a file, or when seeking past the end of a scalar opened
for I/O (in anticipation of future reads and to imitate the behavior
with real files).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s()-on-unopened-%25s"></a><b>%s() on unopened %s</b>
<p>(W unopened) An I/O operation was attempted on a filehandle that was
never initialized.  You need to do an open(), a sysopen(), or a socket()
call, or call a constructor from the FileHandle package.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="-%25s-on-unopened-filehandle-%25s"></a><b>-%s on unopened filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W unopened) You tried to invoke a file test operator on a filehandle
that isn't open.  Check your control flow.  See also <a href="functions/-X.html">-X</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="oops%3a-oopsAV"></a><b>oops: oopsAV</b>
<p>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>

<p>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Opening-dirhandle-%25s-also-as-a-file"></a><b>Opening dirhandle %s also as a file</b>
<p>(D io, deprecated) You used open() to associate a filehandle to
a symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a dirhandle.
Although legal, this idiom might render your code confusing
and is deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Opening-filehandle-%25s-also-as-a-directory"></a><b>Opening filehandle %s also as a directory</b>
<p>(D io, deprecated) You used opendir() to associate a dirhandle to
a symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a filehandle.
Although legal, this idiom might render your code confusing

</li>
<li><a name="Operation-%22%25s%22%3a-no-method-found%2c-%25s"></a><b>Operation "%s": no method found, %s</b>
<p>(F) An attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation for which no

<li><a name="Operation-%22%25s%22-returns-its-argument-for-non-Unicode-code-point-0x%25X"></a><b>Operation "%s" returns its argument for non-Unicode code point 0x%X</b>
<p>(S non_unicode) You performed an operation requiring Unicode rules
on a code point that is not in Unicode, so what it should do is not
defined.  Perl has chosen to have it do nothing, and warn you.</p>
<p>If the operation shown is "ToFold", it means that case-insensitive

<p>(S surrogate) You performed an operation requiring Unicode
rules on a Unicode surrogate.  Unicode frowns upon the use
of surrogates for anything but storing strings in UTF-16, but
rules are (reluctantly) defined for the surrogates, and
they are to do nothing for this operation.  Because the use of
surrogates can be dangerous, Perl warns.</p>

.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Operator-or-semicolon-missing-before-%25s"></a><b>Operator or semicolon missing before %s</b>
<p>(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser
was expecting an operator.  The parser has assumed you really meant to
use an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect.  For
example, if you say "*foo *foo" it will be interpreted as if you said
"*foo * 'foo'".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Optional-parameter-lacks-default-expression"></a><b>Optional parameter lacks default expression</b>
<p>(F) In a subroutine signature, you wrote something like "$a =", making a
named optional parameter without a default value.  A nameless optional
parameter is permitted to have no default value, but a named one must
have a specific default.  You probably want "$a = undef".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%22our%22-variable-%25s-redeclared"></a><b>"our" variable %s redeclared</b>
<p>(W misc) You seem to have already declared the same global once before
in the current lexical scope.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory!"></a><b>Out of memory!</b>
<p>(X) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  Perl has
no option but to exit immediately.</p>
<p>At least in Unix you may be able to get past this by increasing your
process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use <code class="inline"><span class="w">limit</span></code>
 and
<code class="inline"><span class="w">limit</span> <span class="w">datasize</span> <span class="w">n</span></code>
 (where <code class="inline"><span class="w">n</span></code>
 is the number of kilobytes) to check
the current limits and change them, and in ksh/bash/zsh use <code class="inline"><span class="w">ulimit</span> -<span class="w">a</span></code>

and <code class="inline"><span class="w">ulimit</span> -d <span class="w">n</span></code>
, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory-during-%25s-extend"></a><b>Out of memory during %s extend</b>
<p>(X) An attempt was made to extend an array, a list, or a string beyond
the largest possible memory allocation.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory-during-%22large%22-request-for-%25s"></a><b>Out of memory during "large" request for %s</b>
<p>(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  However,
the request was judged large enough (compile-time default is 64K), so a
possibility to shut down by trapping this error is granted.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory-during-request-for-%25s"></a><b>Out of memory during request for %s</b>
<p>(X)(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was
insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the
request.</p>
<p>The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it
depends on the way perl was compiled.  By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$^M</span></code>
 as an
emergency pool after die()ing with this message.  In this case the error
is trappable <i>once</i>, and the error message will include the line and file
where the failed request happened.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory-during-ridiculously-large-request"></a><b>Out of memory during ridiculously large request</b>
<p>(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+"small amount" bytes.  This error
is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g.,
<code class="inline"><span class="i">$arr</span>[<a class="l_k" href="functions/time.html">time</a>]</code>
 instead of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$arr</span>[<span class="i">$time</span>]</code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory-for-yacc-stack"></a><b>Out of memory for yacc stack</b>
<p>(F) The yacc parser wanted to grow its stack so it could continue
parsing, but realloc() wouldn't give it more memory, virtual or
otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'.'-outside-of-string-in-pack"></a><b>'.' outside of string in pack</b>
<p>(F) The argument to a '.' in your template tried to move the working
position to before the start of the packed string being built.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'%40'-outside-of-string-in-unpack"></a><b>'@' outside of string in unpack</b>
<p>(F) You had a template that specified an absolute position outside
the string being unpacked.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>

<p>(F) You had a template that specified an absolute position outside
the string being unpacked.  The string being unpacked was also invalid
UTF-8.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="overload-arg-'%25s'-is-invalid"></a><b>overload arg '%s' is invalid</b>
<p>(W overload) The <a href="overload.html">overload</a> pragma was passed an argument it did not
recognize.  Did you mistype an operator?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Overloaded-dereference-did-not-return-a-reference"></a><b>Overloaded dereference did not return a reference</b>
<p>(F) An object with an overloaded dereference operator was dereferenced,
but the overloaded operation did not return a reference.  See
<a href="overload.html">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Overloaded-qr-did-not-return-a-REGEXP"></a><b>Overloaded qr did not return a REGEXP</b>
<p>(F) An object with a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/qr.html">qr</a></code> overload was used as part of a match, but the
overloaded operation didn't return a compiled regexp.  See <a href="overload.html">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-package-attribute-may-clash-with-future-reserved-word%3a-%25s"></a><b>%s package attribute may clash with future reserved word: %s</b>
<p>(W reserved) A lowercase attribute name was used that had a
package-specific handler.  That name might have a meaning to Perl itself
some day, even though it doesn't yet.  Perhaps you should use a
mixed-case attribute name, instead.  See <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="pack%2funpack-repeat-count-overflow"></a><b>pack/unpack repeat count overflow</b>
<p>(F) You can't specify a repeat count so large that it overflows your
signed integers.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="page-overflow"></a><b>page overflow</b>
<p>(W io) A single call to write() produced more lines than can fit on a

</li>
<li><a name="panic%3a-attempt-to-call-%25s-in-%25s"></a><b>panic: attempt to call %s in %s</b>
<p>(P) One of the file test operators entered a code branch that calls
an ACL related-function, but that function is not available on this

</li>
<li><a name="panic%3a-gp_free-failed-to-free-glob-pointer"></a><b>panic: gp_free failed to free glob pointer</b>
<p>(P) The internal routine used to clear a typeglob's entries tried
repeatedly, but each time something re-created entries in the glob.
Most likely the glob contains an object with a reference back to
the glob and a destructor that adds a new object to the glob.</p>
</li>

In the above the
settings were that the LC_ALL was "En_US" and the LANG had no value.
This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your operating

locale system but Perl could not use those settings.  This was not
dead serious, fortunately: there is a "default locale" called "C" that
Perl can and will use, and the script will be run.  Before you really
fix the problem, however, you will get the same error message each

<p>(F) An ioctl() or fcntl() returned more than Perl was bargaining for.
Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the

<li><a name="Possible-precedence-problem-on-bitwise-%25s-operator"></a><b>Possible precedence problem on bitwise %s operator</b>
<p>(W precedence) Your program uses a bitwise logical operator in conjunction

, due to the
higher precedence of <code class="inline">==</code>
.  This is probably not what you want.  (If you
really meant to write this, disable the warning, or, better, put the
parentheses explicitly and write <code class="inline"><span class="i">$x</span> &amp; <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$y</span> == <span class="n">0</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
).</p>
</li>

The regex <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/foo$\s+bar/m</a></code> translates to: match the word 'foo', the output
record separator (see <a href="perlvar.html#%24%5c">$\ in perlvar</a>) and the letter 's' (one time or more)
followed by the word 'bar'.</p>
<p>If this is what you intended then you can silence the warning by using 
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/${\}/</a></code> (for example: <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/foo${\}s+bar/</a></code>).</p>
<p>If instead you intended to match the word 'foo' at the end of the line
followed by whitespace and the word 'bar' on the next line then you can use
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/$(?)\/</a></code> (for example: <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/foo$(?)\s+bar/</a></code>).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Possible-unintended-interpolation-of-%25s-in-string"></a><b>Possible unintended interpolation of %s in string</b>
<p>(W ambiguous) You said something like '@foo' in a double-quoted string
but there was no array <code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span></code>
 in scope at the time.  If you wanted a
literal @foo, then write it as \@foo; otherwise find out what happened
to the array you apparently lost track of.</p>

 in a
double-quotish string.  All but the last digit is treated as a single
character, specified in octal.  The last digit is the next character in
the string.  To tell Perl that this is indeed what you want, you can use
the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">o</span><span class="s">{</span> <span class="s">}</span></code>

<p>(S internal) Something went wrong in Perl's internal bookkeeping

Perl exited.  What this usually indicates is a memory leak, which
is of course bad, especially if the Perl program is intended to be
long-running.</p>

<p>(W syntax) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a
single element of an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar
value (indicated by $).  The difference is that <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="i">&amp;bar</span>]</code>
 always
behaves like a scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating its
argument, while <code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span>[<span class="i">&amp;bar</span>]</code>
 behaves like a list when you assign to it,
and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things
if you're expecting only one subscript.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the array
element as a list, you need to look into how references work, because
Perl will not magically convert between scalars and lists for you.  See
<a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>

<p>Note that since Perl 5.10.0 a // can also be the <i>defined-or</i>

<p>(A) This is the error message generally seen in a browser window
when trying to run a CGI program (including SSI) over the web.  The
actual error text varies widely from server to server.  The most
frequently-seen variants are "500 Server error", "Method (something)
not permitted", "Document contains no data", "Premature end of script
headers", and "Did not produce a valid header".</p>
<p><b>This is a CGI error, not a Perl error</b>.</p>
<p>You need to make sure your script is executable, is accessible by
the user CGI is running the script under (which is probably not the
user account you tested it under), does not rely on any environment
variables (like PATH) from the user it isn't running under, and isn't
in a location where the CGI server can't find it, basically, more or
less.  Please see the following for more information:</p>

<p>(D deprecated) You assigned a reference to a scalar to <code class="inline"><span class="i">$/</span></code>

to work the same as setting it to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a></code> but was in fact internally
different, less efficient and with very bad luck could have resulted in
your file being split by a stringified form of the reference.</p>
<p>In Perl 5.20.0 this was changed so that it would be <b>exactly</b> the same as
setting <code class="inline"><span class="i">$/</span></code>

<p>You are recommended to change your code to set <code class="inline"><span class="i">$/</span></code>

As of Perl 5.20.0 this is a fatal error, to allow future versions of Perl

You used $a or $b in as an operand to the <code class="inline">&lt;=&gt;</code>

</li>
<li><a name="Subroutine-%22%26%25s%22-is-not-available"></a><b>Subroutine "&amp;%s" is not available</b>
<p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently
available.  This can happen for one of two reasons.  First, the lexical
subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has
not yet been created.  (Remember that named subs are created at compile
time, while anonymous subs are created at run-time.)  For example,</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li><a name="a"></a><a name="f"></a>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> sub <span class="m">a</span> <span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span> sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span> \<span class="i">&amp;a</span> <span class="s">}</span> <span class="s">}</span></li></ol></pre><p>At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current "a" sub,
since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet.  Conversely, the
following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now
been created and is live:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li><a name="a"></a>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> sub <span class="m">a</span> <span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">&#39;sub f { \&amp;a }&#39;</span> <span class="s">}</span>-&gt;<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a lexical subroutine
that has gone out of scope, for example,</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li><a name="f"></a>    sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span></li><li><a name="a"></a>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> sub <span class="m">a</span> <span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">&#39;\&amp;a&#39;</span> <span class="s">}</span></li><li>    <span class="s">}</span></li><li>    <span class="i">f</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span>-&gt;<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>Here, when the '\&amp;a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently
being executed, so its &amp;a is not available for capture.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%22%25s%22-subroutine-%26%25s-masks-earlier-declaration-in-same-%25s"></a><b>"%s" subroutine &amp;%s masks earlier declaration in same %s</b>
<p>(W misc) A "my" or "state" subroutine has been redeclared in the
current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to
the previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.
Note that the earlier subroutine will still exist until the end of
the scope or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Subroutine-%25s-redefined"></a><b>Subroutine %s redefined</b>
<p>(W redefine) You redefined a subroutine.  To suppress this warning, say</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="s">{</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;redefine&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">&quot;sub name { ... }&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <span class="s">}</span></li></ol></pre></li>
<li><a name="Subroutine-%22%25s%22-will-not-stay-shared"></a><b>Subroutine "%s" will not stay shared</b>
<p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a "my"
subroutine defined in an outer named subroutine.</p>
<p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of the outer
subroutine's lexical subroutine as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
longer share a common value for the lexical subroutine.  In other words,
it will no longer be shared.  This will especially make a difference
if the lexical subroutines accesses lexical variables declared in its
surrounding scope.</p>
<p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference lexical subroutines in outer subroutines are created, they
are automatically rebound to the current values of such lexical subs.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Substitution-loop"></a><b>Substitution loop</b>
<p>(P) The substitution was looping infinitely.  (Obviously, a substitution

<li><a name="substr-outside-of-string"></a><b>substr outside of string</b>
<p>(W substr)(F) You tried to reference a substr() that pointed outside of
a string.  That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger than the
length of the string.  See <a href="functions/substr.html">substr</a>.  This warning is fatal if
substr is used in an lvalue context (as the left hand side of an

error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on <b>-w</b>.)
The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
<code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -c</code>
 repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20 questions.</p>

<p>(W internal) Warnings peculiar to VMS.  You tried to change or delete an
element of the CRTL's internal environ array, but your copy of Perl
wasn't built with a CRTL that contained the setenv() function.  You'll
need to rebuild Perl with a CRTL that does, or redefine
<i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see <a href="perlvms.html">perlvms</a>) so that the environ array isn't the
target of the change to

report this warning to the relevant upstream party, or recompile perl
with default options.</p>

<li><a name="times-not-implemented"></a><b>times not implemented</b>
<p>(F) Your version of the C library apparently doesn't do times().  I
suspect you're not running on Unix.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%22-T%22-is-on-the-%23!-line%2c-it-must-also-be-used-on-the-command-line"></a><b>"-T" is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line</b>
<p>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains
the <b>-T</b> option (or the <b>-t</b> option), but Perl was not invoked with
<b>-T</b> in its command line.  This is an error because, by the time
Perl discovers a <b>-T</b> in a script, it's too late to properly taint
everything from the environment.  So Perl gives up.</p>
<p>If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #!
mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be
fixed by editing the #! line so that the <b>-%c</b> option is a part of
Perl's first argument: e.g. change <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -<span class="w">n</span> -<span class="i">%c</span></code>
 to <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -<span class="i">%c</span> -<span class="w">n</span></code>
.</p>
<p>If the Perl script is being executed as <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> <span class="w">scriptname</span></code>
, then the
<b>-%c</b> option must appear on the command line: <code class="inline">perl -%c scriptname</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="To%25s%3a-illegal-mapping-'%25s'"></a><b>To%s: illegal mapping '%s'</b>
<p>(F) You tried to define a customized To-mapping for lc(), lcfirst,

system call to call, silly dilly.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Too-few-arguments-for-subroutine"></a><b>Too few arguments for subroutine</b>
<p>(F) A subroutine using a signature received fewer arguments than required
by the signature.  The caller of the subroutine is presumably at fault.
Inconveniently, this error will be reported at the location of the
subroutine, not that of the caller.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Too-late-for-%22-%25s%22-option"></a><b>Too late for "-%s" option</b>
<p>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
<b>-M</b>, <b>-m</b> or <b>-C</b> option.</p>
<p>In the case of <b>-M</b> and <b>-m</b>, this is an error because those options
are not intended for use inside scripts.  Use the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code> pragma instead.</p>
<p>The <b>-C</b> option only works if it is specified on the command line as
well (with the same sequence of letters or numbers following).  Either
specify this option on the command line, or, if your system supports
it, make your script executable and run it directly instead of passing
it to perl.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Too-late-to-run-%25s-block"></a><b>Too late to run %s block</b>
<p>(W void) A CHECK or INIT block is being defined during run time proper,
when the opportunity to run them has already passed.  Perhaps you are
loading a file with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do.html">do</a></code> when you should be using <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code>

BEGIN block.</p>

<p>(F) The function requires fewer arguments than you specified.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Too-many-arguments-for-subroutine"></a><b>Too many arguments for subroutine</b>
<p>(F) A subroutine using a signature received more arguments than required

<p>(F) The subroutine in question in the CORE package requires its argument
to be a hard reference to data of the specified type.  Overloading is
ignored, so a reference to an object that is not the specified type, but
nonetheless has overloading to handle it, will still not be accepted.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Type-of-arg-%25d-to-%25s-must-be-%25s-(not-%25s)"></a><b>Type of arg %d to %s must be %s (not %s)</b>
<p>(F) This function requires the argument in that position to be of a
certain type.  Arrays must be @NAME or <code class="inline"><span class="i">@</span>{<span class="w">EXPR</span>}</code>
.  Hashes must be
%NAME or <code class="inline"><span class="i">%</span>{<span class="w">EXPR</span>}</code>
.  No implicit dereferencing is allowed--use the

</li>
<li><a name="Type-of-argument-to-%25s-must-be-unblessed-hashref-or-arrayref"></a><b>Type of argument to %s must be unblessed hashref or arrayref</b>

<p>(S nonchar) Certain codepoints, such as U+FFFE and U+FFFF, are
defined by the Unicode standard to be non-characters.  Those
are legal codepoints, but are reserved for internal use; so,
applications shouldn't attempt to exchange them.  An application
may not be expecting any of these characters at all, and receiving
them may lead to bugs.  If you know what you are doing you can

<p>This is not really a "severe" error, but it is supposed to be

</li>
<li><a name="Unicode-surrogate-U%2b%25X-is-illegal-in-UTF-8"></a><b>Unicode surrogate U+%X is illegal in UTF-8</b>
<p>(S surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context where they are
not considered acceptable.  These code points, between U+D800 and
U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16.  However, Perl
internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit
available on your platform), including surrogates.  But these can cause
problems when being input or output, which is likely where this message

<p>(F) Alphanumerics immediately following the closing delimiter
of a regular expression pattern are interpreted by Perl as modifier

<p>(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does
nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a

often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl

get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and
said</p>

<p>(W locale)  You are matching a regular expression using locale rules,

).
This construct was deprecated in 5.12.0, and has now been made a syntax

</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-freed-value-in-iteration"></a><b>Use of freed value in iteration</b>
<p>(F) Perhaps you modified the iterated array within the loop?
This error is typically caused by code like the following:</p>

For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does not do full
reference-counting of iterated items, hence deleting such an item in the
middle of an iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-*glob%7bFILEHANDLE%7d-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of *glob{FILEHANDLE} is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You are now encouraged to use the shorter *glob{IO} form

</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-%2fg-modifier-is-meaningless-in-split"></a><b>Use of /g modifier is meaningless in split</b>
<p>(W regexp) You used the /g modifier on the pattern for a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/split.html">split</a></code>

repeatedly, the <code class="inline">/g</code> has no effect.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-%22goto%22-to-jump-into-a-construct-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of "goto" to jump into a construct is deprecated</b>

</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-inherited-AUTOLOAD-for-non-method-%25s()-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>

subroutines are looked up as methods (using the <code class="inline"><span class="i">@ISA</span></code>
 hierarchy)
even when the subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain
functions (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="i">Foo::bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
), not as methods (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="w">Foo</span><span class="w">-&gt;bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 or
<code class="inline"><span class="i">$obj</span><span class="i">-&gt;bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
).</p>
<p>This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods' <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
s.  However, there is a significant base of existing
code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited
<code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
s.</p>
<p>The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used
to depend on inheriting <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
 for non-methods from a base class
named <code class="inline"><span class="w">BaseClass</span></code>
, execute <code class="inline"><span class="i">*AUTOLOAD</span> = \<span class="i">&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</span></code>
 during
startup.</p>
<p>In code that currently says <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="i">@ISA</span> = <span class="q">qw(AutoLoader)</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>

you should remove AutoLoader from @ISA and change <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
 to
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span> <span class="q">&#39;AUTOLOAD&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>

the control character whose code point is 0x01.) This only affects
code like <code class="inline"><span class="i">$\</span><span class="w">cT</span></code>

for historical reasons.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of--l-on-filehandle%25s"></a><b>Use of -l on filehandle%s</b>
<p>(W io) A filehandle represents an opened file, and when you opened the file
it already went past any symlink you are presumably trying to look for.
The operation returned <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a></code>.  Use a filename instead.</p>

<p>This was a long-standing bug that was removed in Perl 5.16, as there was
no way to tie the scalar itself when it held a typeglob, and no way to

</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-reference-%22%25s%22-as-array-index"></a><b>Use of reference "%s" as array index</b>
<p>(W misc) You tried to use a reference as an array index; this probably

<code class="inline"><span class="i">$array</span>[<span class="n">0</span>+<span class="i">$ref</span>]</code>
.  This warning is not given for overloaded objects,
however, because you can overload the numification and stringification

To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.</p>
<p>To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you
the name of the variable (if any) that was undefined.  In some cases
it cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation you used the
undefined value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your program
and the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear
literally in your program.  For example, <code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;that $foo&quot;</span></code>
 is usually
optimized into <code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;that &quot;</span> . <span class="i">$foo</span></code>

these circumstances, Perl discards all but the first character

internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit
available on your platform), including surrogates.  But these can cause
problems when being input or output, which is likely where this message

can return a value of "0"; that would make the conditional expression

<li><a name="Variable-%22%25s%22-is-not-available"></a><b>Variable "%s" is not available</b>
<p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available.
This can happen for one of two reasons.  First, the outer lexical may be
declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
(Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous
subs are created at run-time.)  For example,</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li><a name="f"></a>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span> sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$a</span> <span class="s">}</span> <span class="s">}</span></li></ol></pre><p>At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current value of $a,
since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet.  Conversely,
the following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by
now been created and is live:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">'sub f { $a }'</span> <span class="s">}</span>-&gt;<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li><a name="f"></a>    sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">'$a'</span> <span class="s">}</span></li><li>    <span class="s">}</span></li><li>    <span class="i">f</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span>-&gt;<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>Here, when the '$a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently
being executed, so its $a is not available for capture.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-%22%25s%22-is-not-imported%25s"></a><b>Variable "%s" is not imported%s</b>
<p>(S misc) With "use strict" in effect, you referred to a global variable
that you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by
that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny character on the
front of your variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-length-lookbehind-not-implemented-in-regex-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>Variable length lookbehind not implemented in regex m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) Lookbehind is allowed only for subexpressions whose length is fixed and
known at compile time.  For positive lookbehind, you can use the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">K</span></code>

regex construct as a way to get the equivalent functionality.  See
<a href="perlre.html#(%3f%3c%3dpattern)-%5cK">(?&lt;=pattern) \K in perlre</a>.</p>
<p>There are non-obvious Unicode rules under <code class="inline">/i</code> that can match variably,
but which you might not think could.  For example, the substring <code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;ss&quot;</span></code>

can match the single character LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S.  There are
other sequences of ASCII characters that can match single ligature
characters, such as LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI matching <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/qr.html">qr/ffi/i</a></code>.
Starting in Perl v5.16, if you only care about ASCII matches, adding the
<code class="inline"><span class="q">/aa</span></code>
 modifier to the regex will exclude all these non-obvious matches,
thus getting rid of this message.  You can also say <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">qw(/aa)</span></code>

to apply <code class="inline"><span class="q">/aa</span></code>
 to all regular expressions compiled within its scope.
See <a href="re.html">re</a>.</p>

<li><a name="%22%25s%22-variable-%25s-masks-earlier-declaration-in-same-%25s"></a><b>"%s" variable %s masks earlier declaration in same %s</b>
<p>(W misc) A "my", "our" or "state" variable has been redeclared in the
current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the
previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.  Note
that the earlier variable will still exist until the end of the scope
or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-syntax"></a><b>Variable syntax</b>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead

Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-%22%25s%22-will-not-stay-shared"></a><b>Variable "%s" will not stay shared</b>
<p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a
lexical variable defined in an outer named subroutine.</p>
<p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of
the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
longer share a common value for the variable.  In other words, the
variable will no longer be shared.</p>
<p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer subroutines are created, they
are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.</p>

<li><a name="Wide-character-in-%25s"></a><b>Wide character in %s</b>
<p>(S utf8) Perl met a wide character (&gt;255) when it wasn't expecting
one.  This warning is by default on for I/O (like print).  The easiest
way to quiet this warning is simply to add the <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">utf8</span></code>
 layer to the
output, e.g. <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/binmode.html">binmode</a> <span class="w">STDOUT</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&#39;:utf8&#39;</span></code>
.  Another way to turn off the
warning is to add <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;utf8&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
 but that is often closer to
cheating.  In general, you are supposed to explicitly mark the
filehandle with an encoding, see <a href="open.html">open</a> and <a href="functions/binmode.html">binmode</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Wide-character-(U%2b%25X)-in-%25s"></a><b>Wide character (U+%X) in %s</b>
<p>(W locale) While in a single-byte locale (<i>i.e.</i>, a non-UTF-8
one), a multi-byte character was encountered.   Perl considers this
character to be the specified Unicode code point.  Combining non-UTF-8
locales and Unicode is dangerous.  Almost certainly some characters
will have two different representations.  For example, in the ISO 8859-7
(Greek) locale, the code point 0xC3 represents a Capital Gamma.  But so
also does 0x393.  This will make string comparisons unreliable.</p>
<p>You likely need to figure out how this multi-byte character got mixed up
with your single-byte locale (or perhaps you thought you had a UTF-8
locale, but Perl disagrees).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Within-%5b%5d-length-'%25c'-not-allowed"></a><b>Within []-length '%c' not allowed</b>
<p>(F) The count in the (un)pack template may be replaced by <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">TEMPLATE</span><span class="s">]</span></code>

only if <code class="inline"><span class="w">TEMPLATE</span></code>

can be determined from the template alone.  This is not possible if
it contains any of the codes @, /, U, u, w or a *-length.  Redesign
the template.</p>

<p>(S utf8) When reading in different encodings, Perl tries to

<p>(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.
Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared,
