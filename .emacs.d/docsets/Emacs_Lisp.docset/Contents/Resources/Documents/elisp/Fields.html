<h4 class="subsection">31.19.9 Defining and Using Fields</h4>

<p><a name="index-fields-3117"></a>
  A field is a range of consecutive characters in the buffer that are
identified by having the same value (comparing with <code>eq</code>) of the
<code>field</code> property (either a text-property or an overlay property). 
This section describes special functions that are available for
operating on fields.

   </p><p>You specify a field with a buffer position, <var>pos</var>.  We think of
each field as containing a range of buffer positions, so the position
you specify stands for the field containing that position.

   </p><p>When the characters before and after <var>pos</var> are part of the same
field, there is no doubt which field contains <var>pos</var>: the one those
characters both belong to.  When <var>pos</var> is at a boundary between
fields, which field it belongs to depends on the stickiness of the
<code>field</code> properties of the two surrounding characters (see <a href="Sticky-Properties.html#Sticky-Properties">Sticky Properties</a>).  The field whose property would be inherited by text
inserted at <var>pos</var> is the field that contains <var>pos</var>.

   </p><p>There is an anomalous case where newly inserted text at <var>pos</var>
would not inherit the <code>field</code> property from either side.  This
happens if the previous character's <code>field</code> property is not
rear-sticky, and the following character's <code>field</code> property is not
front-sticky.  In this case, <var>pos</var> belongs to neither the preceding
field nor the following field; the field functions treat it as belonging
to an empty field whose beginning and end are both at <var>pos</var>.

   </p><p>In all of these functions, if <var>pos</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, the
value of point is used by default.  If narrowing is in effect, then
<var>pos</var> should fall within the accessible portion.  See <a href="Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.

        </p><p>If <var>pos</var> is at the beginning of its field, and

always the beginning of the preceding field that <em>ends</em> at <var>pos</var>,
regardless of the stickiness of the <code>field</code> properties around
<var>pos</var>.

        </p><p>If <var>limit</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it is a buffer position; if the
beginning of the field is before <var>limit</var>, then <var>limit</var> will be
returned instead.

field that <em>begins</em> at <var>pos</var>, regardless of the stickiness of
the <code>field</code> properties around <var>pos</var>.

        </p><p>If <var>limit</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it is a buffer position; if the end
of the field is after <var>limit</var>, then <var>limit</var> will be returned

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/constrain%2Dto%2Dfield"></a><a name="DASH-862"></a>— Function: <b>constrain-to-field</b><var> new-pos old-pos &amp;optional escape-from-edge only-in-line inhibit-capture-property<a name="index-constrain_002dto_002dfield-3123"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function “constrains” <var>new-pos</var> to the field that
<var>old-pos</var> belongs to—in other words, it returns the position
closest to <var>new-pos</var> that is in the same field as <var>old-pos</var>.

        </p><p>If <var>new-pos</var> is <code>nil</code>, then <code>constrain-to-field</code> uses
the value of point instead, and moves point to the resulting position
in addition to returning that position.

        </p><p>If <var>old-pos</var> is at the boundary of two fields, then the acceptable
final positions depend on the argument <var>escape-from-edge</var>.  If
<var>escape-from-edge</var> is <code>nil</code>, then <var>new-pos</var> must be in
the field whose <code>field</code> property equals what new characters
inserted at <var>old-pos</var> would inherit.  (This depends on the
stickiness of the <code>field</code> property for the characters before and
after <var>old-pos</var>.)  If <var>escape-from-edge</var> is non-<code>nil</code>,
<var>new-pos</var> can be anywhere in the two adjacent fields. 
Additionally, if two fields are separated by another field with the
special value <code>boundary</code>, then any point within this special
field is also considered to be “on the boundary”.

        </p><p>Commands like <kbd>C-a</kbd> with no argument, that normally move backward
to a specific kind of location and stay there once there, probably
should specify <code>nil</code> for <var>escape-from-edge</var>.  Other motion
commands that check fields should probably pass <code>t</code>.

        </p><p>If the optional argument <var>only-in-line</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, and
constraining <var>new-pos</var> in the usual way would move it to a different
line, <var>new-pos</var> is returned unconstrained.  This used in commands
that move by line, such as <code>next-line</code> and
<code>beginning-of-line</code>, so that they respect field boundaries only in
the case where they can still move to the right line.

        </p><p>If the optional argument <var>inhibit-capture-property</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, and <var>old-pos</var> has a non-<code>nil</code> property of that
name, then any field boundaries are ignored.

        </p><p>You can cause <code>constrain-to-field</code> to ignore all field boundaries
(and so never constrain anything) by binding the variable
<code>inhibit-field-text-motion</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.
