<h3 class="section">39.3 Multi-file Packages</h3>

<p><a name="index-multi_002dfile-package-4365"></a>
  A multi-file package is less convenient to create than a single-file
package, but it offers more features: it can include multiple Emacs
Lisp files, an Info manual, and other file types (such as images).

   </p><p>Prior to installation, a multi-file package is stored in a package
archive as a tar file.  The tar file must be named
<samp><var>name</var><span class="file">-</span><var>version</var><span class="file">.tar</span></samp>, where <var>name</var> is the package
name and <var>version</var> is the version number.  Its contents, once
extracted, must all appear in a directory named
<samp><var>name</var><span class="file">-</span><var>version</var></samp>, the <dfn>content directory</dfn>
(see <a href="Packaging-Basics.html#Packaging-Basics">Packaging Basics</a>).  Files may also extract into
subdirectories of the content directory.

   </p><p>One of the files in the content directory must be named
<samp><var>name</var><span class="file">-pkg.el</span></samp>.  It must contain a single Lisp form,
consisting of a call to the function <code>define-package</code>, described
below.  This defines the package's version, brief description, and
requirements.

   </p><p>For example, if we distribute version 1.3 of the superfrobnicator as
a multi-file package, the tar file would be
<samp><span class="file">superfrobnicator-1.3.tar</span></samp>.  Its contents would extract into the
directory <samp><span class="file">superfrobnicator-1.3</span></samp>, and one of these would be the
file <samp><span class="file">superfrobnicator-pkg.el</span></samp>.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/define%2Dpackage"></a><a name="DASH-1452"></a>â€” Function: <b>define-package</b><var> name version &amp;optional docstring requirements<a name="index-define_002dpackage-4366"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function defines a package.  <var>name</var> is the package name, a
string.  <var>version</var> is the version, as a string of a form that can
be understood by the function <code>version-to-list</code>.  <var>docstring</var>
is the brief description.

        </p><p><var>requirements</var> is a list of required packages and their versions. 
Each element in this list should have the form <code>(</code><var>dep-name</var>
<var>dep-version</var><code>)</code>, where <var>dep-name</var> is a symbol whose name is
the dependency's package name, and <var>dep-version</var> is the
dependency's version (a string). 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If the content directory contains a file named <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp>, this
file is used as the long description.

   </p><p>If the content directory contains a file named <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp>, this is
assumed to be an Info directory file made with <samp><span class="command">install-info</span></samp>. 
See <a href="../texinfo/Invoking-install_002dinfo.html#Invoking-install_002dinfo">Invoking install-info</a>.  The relevant Info files should also
be present in the content directory.  In this case, Emacs will
automatically add the content directory to <code>Info-directory-list</code>
when the package is activated.

   </p><p>Do not include any <samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> files in the package.  Those are
created when the package is installed.  Note that there is no way to
control the order in which files are byte-compiled.

   </p><p>Do not include any file named <samp><var>name</var><span class="file">-autoloads.el</span></samp>.  This
file is reserved for the package's autoload definitions
(see <a href="Packaging-Basics.html#Packaging-Basics">Packaging Basics</a>).  It is created automatically when the
package is installed, by searching all the Lisp files in the package
for autoload magic comments.

   </p><p>If the multi-file package contains auxiliary data files (such as
images), the package's Lisp code can refer to these files via the
variable <code>load-file-name</code> (see <a href="Loading.html#Loading">Loading</a>).  Here is an example:

</p><pre class="smallexample">     (defconst superfrobnicator-base (file-name-directory load-file-name))
     
     (defun superfrobnicator-fetch-image (file)
       (expand-file-name file superfrobnicator-base))
</pre>
