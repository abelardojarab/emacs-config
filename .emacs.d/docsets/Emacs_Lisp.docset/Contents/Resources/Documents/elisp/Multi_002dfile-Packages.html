<h3 class="section">39.3 Multi-file Packages</h3>
<a name="index-multi_002dfile-package"></a>

<p>A multi-file package is less convenient to create than a single-file
package, but it offers more features: it can include multiple Emacs
Lisp files, an Info manual, and other file types (such as images).
</p>
<p>Prior to installation, a multi-file package is stored in a package
archive as a tar file.  The tar file must be named
<samp><var>name</var>-<var>version</var>.tar</samp>, where <var>name</var> is the package
name and <var>version</var> is the version number.  Its contents, once
extracted, must all appear in a directory named
<samp><var>name</var>-<var>version</var></samp>, the <em>content directory</em>
(see <a href="Packaging-Basics.html#Packaging-Basics">Packaging Basics</a>).  Files may also extract into
subdirectories of the content directory.
</p>
<p>One of the files in the content directory must be named
<samp><var>name</var>-pkg.el</samp>.  It must contain a single Lisp form,
consisting of a call to the function <code>define-package</code>, described
below.  This defines the package’s version, brief description, and
requirements.
</p>
<p>For example, if we distribute version 1.3 of the superfrobnicator as
a multi-file package, the tar file would be
<samp>superfrobnicator-1.3.tar</samp>.  Its contents would extract into the
directory <samp>superfrobnicator-1.3</samp>, and one of these would be the
file <samp>superfrobnicator-pkg.el</samp>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/define%2Dpackage"></a><a name="index-define_002dpackage"></a>Function: <strong>define-package</strong> <em>name version &amp;optional docstring requirements</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function defines a package.  <var>name</var> is the package name, a
string.  <var>version</var> is the version, as a string of a form that can
be understood by the function <code>version-to-list</code>.  <var>docstring</var>
is the brief description.
</p>
<p><var>requirements</var> is a list of required packages and their versions.
Each element in this list should have the form <code>(<var>dep-name</var>
<var>dep-version</var>)</code>, where <var>dep-name</var> is a symbol whose name is
the dependency’s package name, and <var>dep-version</var> is the
dependency’s version (a string).
</p></dd></dl>

<p>If the content directory contains a file named <samp>README</samp>, this
file is used as the long description.
</p>
<p>If the content directory contains a file named <samp>dir</samp>, this is
assumed to be an Info directory file made with <code>install-info</code>.
See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/html_node/Invoking-install_002dinfo.html#Invoking-install_002dinfo">Invoking
install-info</a> in <cite>Texinfo</cite>.  The relevant Info files should also
be present in the content directory.  In this case, Emacs will
automatically add the content directory to <code>Info-directory-list</code>
when the package is activated.
</p>
<p>Do not include any <samp>.elc</samp> files in the package.  Those are
created when the package is installed.  Note that there is no way to
control the order in which files are byte-compiled.
</p>
<p>Do not include any file named <samp><var>name</var>-autoloads.el</samp>.  This
file is reserved for the package’s autoload definitions
(see <a href="Packaging-Basics.html#Packaging-Basics">Packaging Basics</a>).  It is created automatically when the
package is installed, by searching all the Lisp files in the package
for autoload magic comments.
</p>
<p>If the multi-file package contains auxiliary data files (such as
images), the package’s Lisp code can refer to these files via the
variable <code>load-file-name</code> (see <a href="Loading.html#Loading">Loading</a>).  Here is an example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">(defconst superfrobnicator-base (file-name-directory load-file-name))

(defun superfrobnicator-fetch-image (file)
  (expand-file-name file superfrobnicator-base))
</pre></div>
