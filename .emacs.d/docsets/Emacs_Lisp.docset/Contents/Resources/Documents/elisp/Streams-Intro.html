<p><em>Reading</em> a Lisp object means parsing a Lisp expression in textual
form and producing a corresponding Lisp object.  This is how Lisp
programs get into Lisp from files of Lisp code.  We call the text the
<em>read syntax</em> of the object.  For example, the text &lsquo;<samp>(a . 5)</samp>&rsquo;
is the read syntax for a cons cell whose <small>CAR</small> is <code>a</code> and whose
<small>CDR</small> is the number 5.
</p>
<p><em>Printing</em> a Lisp object means producing text that represents that
object&mdash;converting the object to its <em>printed representation</em>
(see <a href="Printed-Representation.html#Printed-Representation">Printed Representation</a>).  Printing the cons cell described
above produces the text &lsquo;<samp>(a . 5)</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Reading and printing are more or less inverse operations: printing the
object that results from reading a given piece of text often produces
the same text, and reading the text that results from printing an object
usually produces a similar-looking object.  For example, printing the
symbol <code>foo</code> produces the text &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo;, and reading that text
returns the symbol <code>foo</code>.  Printing a list whose elements are
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> produces the text &lsquo;<samp>(a b)</samp>&rsquo;, and reading that
text produces a list (but not the same list) with elements <code>a</code>
and <code>b</code>.
</p>
<p>However, these two operations are not precisely inverse to each other.
There are three kinds of exceptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Printing can produce text that cannot be read.  For example, buffers,
windows, frames, subprocesses and markers print as text that starts
with &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo;; if you try to read this text, you get an error.  There is
no way to read those data types.

</li><li> One object can have multiple textual representations.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>01</samp>&rsquo; represent the same integer, and &lsquo;<samp>(a b)</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>(a . (b))</samp>&rsquo; represent the same list.  Reading will accept any of
the alternatives, but printing must choose one of them.

</li><li> Comments can appear at certain points in the middle of an object&rsquo;s
read sequence without affecting the result of reading it.
</li></ul>
