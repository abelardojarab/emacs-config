<h3 class="section">D.4 Tips for Making Compiled Code Fast</h3>

<p><a name="index-execution-speed-4386"></a><a name="index-speedups-4387"></a>
  Here are ways of improving the execution speed of byte-compiled
Lisp programs.

     <ul>
<li>Profile your program, to find out where the time is being spent. 
See <a href="Profiling.html#Profiling">Profiling</a>.

     <li>Use iteration rather than recursion whenever possible. 
Function calls are slow in Emacs Lisp even when a compiled function
is calling another compiled function.

     <li>Using the primitive list-searching functions <code>memq</code>, <code>member</code>,
<code>assq</code>, or <code>assoc</code> is even faster than explicit iteration.  It
can be worth rearranging a data structure so that one of these primitive
search functions can be used.

     <li>Certain built-in functions are handled specially in byte-compiled code,
avoiding the need for an ordinary function call.  It is a good idea to
use these functions rather than alternatives.  To see whether a function
is handled specially by the compiler, examine its <code>byte-compile</code>
property.  If the property is non-<code>nil</code>, then the function is
handled specially.

     <p>For example, the following input will show you that <code>aref</code> is
compiled specially (see <a href="Array-Functions.html#Array-Functions">Array Functions</a>):

     <pre class="example">          (get 'aref 'byte-compile)
               &rArr; byte-compile-two-args
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note that in this case (and many others), you must first load the
<samp><span class="file">bytecomp</span></samp> library, which defines the <code>byte-compile</code> property.

     <li>If calling a small function accounts for a substantial part of your
program's running time, make the function inline.  This eliminates
the function call overhead.  Since making a function inline reduces
the flexibility of changing the program, don't do it unless it gives
a noticeable speedup in something slow enough that users care about
the speed.  See <a href="Inline-Functions.html#Inline-Functions">Inline Functions</a>. 
</ul>
