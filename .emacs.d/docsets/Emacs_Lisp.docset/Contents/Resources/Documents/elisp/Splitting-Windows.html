<h3 class="section">27.5 Splitting Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-splitting-windows-2319"></a><a name="index-window-splitting-2320"></a>
This section describes functions for creating a new window by
<dfn>splitting</dfn> an existing one.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/split%2Dwindow"></a><a name="DASH-1958"></a>— Function: <b>split-window</b><var> &amp;optional window size side pixelwise<a name="index-split_002dwindow-2321"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function creates a new live window next to the window
<var>window</var>.  If <var>window</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, it defaults
to the selected window.  That window is “split”, and reduced in
size.  The space is taken up by the new window, which is returned.

        </p><p>The optional second argument <var>size</var> determines the sizes of
<var>window</var> and/or the new window.  If it is omitted or <code>nil</code>,
both windows are given equal sizes; if there is an odd line, it is
allocated to the new window.  If <var>size</var> is a positive number,
<var>window</var> is given <var>size</var> lines (or columns, depending on the
value of <var>side</var>).  If <var>size</var> is a negative number, the new
window is given −<var>size</var> lines (or columns).

        </p><p>If <var>size</var> is <code>nil</code>, this function obeys the variables
<code>window-min-height</code> and <code>window-min-width</code> (see <a href="Window-Sizes.html#Window-Sizes">Window Sizes</a>).  Thus, it signals an error if splitting would result in making
a window smaller than those variables specify.  However, a
non-<code>nil</code> value for <var>size</var> causes those variables to be
ignored; in that case, the smallest allowable window is considered to be
one that has space for a text area one line tall and/or two columns
wide.

        </p><p>Hence, if <var>size</var> is specified, it's the caller's responsibility to
check whether the emanating windows are large enough to encompass all
areas like a mode line or a scroll bar.  The function
<code>window-min-size</code> (see <a href="Window-Sizes.html#Window-Sizes">Window Sizes</a>) can be used to determine
the minimum requirements of <var>window</var> in this regard.  Since the new
window usually “inherits” areas like the mode line or the scroll bar
from <var>window</var>, that function is also a good guess for the minimum
size of the new window.  The caller should specify a smaller size only
if it correspondingly removes an inherited area before the next
redisplay.

        </p><p>The optional third argument <var>side</var> determines the position of the
new window relative to <var>window</var>.  If it is <code>nil</code> or
<code>below</code>, the new window is placed below <var>window</var>.  If it is
<code>above</code>, the new window is placed above <var>window</var>.  In both
these cases, <var>size</var> specifies a total window height, in lines.

        </p><p>If <var>side</var> is <code>t</code> or <code>right</code>, the new window is placed on
the right of <var>window</var>.  If <var>side</var> is <code>left</code>, the new
window is placed on the left of <var>window</var>.  In both these cases,
<var>size</var> specifies a total window width, in columns.

        </p><p>The optional fourth argument <var>pixelwise</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means
to interpret <var>size</var> in units of pixels, instead of lines and
columns.

        </p><p>If <var>window</var> is a live window, the new window inherits various
properties from it, including margins and scroll bars.  If
<var>window</var> is an internal window, the new window inherits the
properties of the window selected within <var>window</var>'s frame.

        </p><p>The behavior of this function may be altered by the window parameters
of <var>window</var>, so long as the variable
<code>ignore-window-parameters</code> is <code>nil</code>.  If the value of
the <code>split-window</code> window parameter is <code>t</code>, this function
ignores all other window parameters.  Otherwise, if the value of the
<code>split-window</code> window parameter is a function, that function is
called with the arguments <var>window</var>, <var>size</var>, and <var>side</var>, in
lieu of the usual action of <code>split-window</code>.  Otherwise, this
function obeys the <code>window-atom</code> or <code>window-side</code> window
parameter, if any.  See <a href="Window-Parameters.html#Window-Parameters">Window Parameters</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>As an example, here is a sequence of <code>split-window</code> calls that
yields the window configuration discussed in <a href="Windows-and-Frames.html#Windows-and-Frames">Windows and Frames</a>. 
This example demonstrates splitting a live window as well as splitting
an internal window.  We begin with a frame containing a single window
(a live root window), which we denote by <var>W4</var>.  Calling
<code>(split-window W4)</code> yields this window configuration:

         ||                                    ||

         ||_________________W5_________________||
         |__________________W3__________________|
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>split-window</code> call has created a new live window, denoted by
<var>W5</var>.  It has also created a new internal window, denoted by
<var>W3</var>, which becomes the root window and the parent of both
<var>W4</var> and <var>W5</var>.

   </p><p>Next, we call <code>(split-window W3 nil 'left)</code>, passing the
internal window <var>W3</var> as the argument.  The result:

   <p class="noindent">A new live window <var>W2</var> is created, to the left of the internal
window <var>W3</var>.  A new internal window <var>W1</var> is created, becoming
the new root window.

   </p><p>For interactive use, Emacs provides two commands which always split
the selected window.  These call <code>split-window</code> internally.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/split%2Dwindow%2Dright"></a><a name="DASH-1959"></a>— Command: <b>split-window-right</b><var> &amp;optional size<a name="index-split_002dwindow_002dright-2322"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function splits the selected window into two side-by-side
windows, putting the selected window on the left.  If <var>size</var> is
positive, the left window gets <var>size</var> columns; if <var>size</var> is
negative, the right window gets −<var>size</var> columns. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/split%2Dwindow%2Dbelow"></a><a name="DASH-1960"></a>— Command: <b>split-window-below</b><var> &amp;optional size<a name="index-split_002dwindow_002dbelow-2323"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function splits the selected window into two windows, one above
the other, leaving the upper window selected.  If <var>size</var> is
positive, the upper window gets <var>size</var> lines; if <var>size</var> is
negative, the lower window gets −<var>size</var> lines. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/split%2Dwindow%2Dkeep%2Dpoint"></a><a name="DASH-1961"></a>— User Option: <b>split-window-keep-point</b><var><a name="index-split_002dwindow_002dkeep_002dpoint-2324"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If the value of this variable is non-<code>nil</code> (the default),
<code>split-window-below</code> behaves as described above.

        </p><p>If it is <code>nil</code>, <code>split-window-below</code> adjusts point in each
of the two windows to minimize redisplay.  (This is useful on slow
terminals.)  It selects whichever window contains the screen line that
point was previously on.  Note that this only affects
<code>split-window-below</code>, not the lower-level <code>split-window</code>
function.
