<h3 class="section">17.5 Profiling</h3>

<p><a name="index-profiling-1074"></a><a name="index-measuring-resource-usage-1075"></a><a name="index-memory-usage-1076"></a>
If your program is working correctly, but you want to make it run more
quickly or efficiently, the first thing to do is <dfn>profile</dfn> your
code so that you know how it is using resources.  If you find that one
particular function is responsible for a significant portion of the
runtime, you can start looking for ways to optimize that piece.

   <p>Emacs has built-in support for this.  To begin profiling, type
<kbd>M-x profiler-start</kbd>.  You can choose to profile by processor
usage, memory usage, or both.  After doing some work, type
<kbd>M-x profiler-report</kbd> to display a summary buffer for each
resource that you chose to profile.  The names of the report buffers
include the times at which the reports were generated, so you can
generate another report later on without erasing previous results. 
When you have finished profiling, type <kbd>M-x profiler-stop</kbd> (there
is a small overhead associated with profiling).

   <p>The profiler report buffer shows, on each line, a function that was
called, followed by how much resource (processor or memory) it used in
absolute and percentage times since profiling started.  If a given
line has a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol at the left-hand side, you can expand that
line by typing &lt;RET&gt;, in order to see the function(s) called by
the higher-level function.  Pressing &lt;RET&gt; again will collapse
back to the original state.

   <p>Press <kbd>j</kbd> or <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> to jump to the definition of a function. 
Press <kbd>d</kbd> to view a function's documentation. 
You can save a profile to a file using <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd>. 
You can compare two profiles using <kbd>=</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007belp_002eel_007d-1077"></a><a name="index-timing-programs-1078"></a>The <samp><span class="file">elp</span></samp> library offers an alternative approach.  See the file
<samp><span class="file">elp.el</span></samp> for instructions.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bbenchmark_002eel_007d-1079"></a><a name="index-benchmarking-1080"></a>You can check the speed of individual Emacs Lisp forms using the
<samp><span class="file">benchmark</span></samp> library.  See the functions <code>benchmark-run</code> and
<code>benchmark-run-compiled</code> in <samp><span class="file">benchmark.el</span></samp>.

<!-- Not worth putting in the printed manual. -->
   <p><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dprofiling-option-of-configure-1081"></a>To profile Emacs at the level of its C code, you can build it using the
<samp><span class="option">--enable-profiling</span></samp> option of <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.  When Emacs
exits, it generates a file <samp><span class="file">gmon.out</span></samp> that you can examine using
the <samp><span class="command">gprof</span></samp> utility.  This feature is mainly useful for
debugging Emacs.  It actually stops the Lisp-level <kbd>M-x
profiler-...</kbd> commands described above from working.
