<h3 class="section">12.13 Inline Functions</h3>
<a name="index-inline-functions"></a>

<p>An <em>inline function</em> is a function that works just like an
ordinary function, except for one thing: when you byte-compile a call
to the function (see <a href="Byte-Compilation.html#Byte-Compilation">Byte Compilation</a>), the function’s definition
is expanded into the caller.  To define an inline function, use
<code>defsubst</code> instead of <code>defun</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/macro/defsubst"></a><a name="index-defsubst"></a>Macro: <strong>defsubst</strong> <em>name args [doc] [declare] [interactive] body…</em></dt>
<dd><p>This macro defines an inline function.  Its syntax is exactly the same
as <code>defun</code> (see <a href="Defining-Functions.html#Defining-Functions">Defining Functions</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Making a function inline often makes its function calls run faster.
But it also has disadvantages.  For one thing, it reduces flexibility;
if you change the definition of the function, calls already inlined
still use the old definition until you recompile them.
</p>
<p>Another disadvantage is that making a large function inline can
increase the size of compiled code both in files and in memory.  Since
the speed advantage of inline functions is greatest for small
functions, you generally should not make large functions inline.
</p>
<p>Also, inline functions do not behave well with respect to debugging,
tracing, and advising (see <a href="Advising-Functions.html#Advising-Functions">Advising Functions</a>).  Since ease of
debugging and the flexibility of redefining functions are important
features of Emacs, you should not make a function inline, even if it’s
small, unless its speed is really crucial, and you’ve timed the code
to verify that using <code>defun</code> actually has performance problems.
</p>
<p>After an inline function is defined, its inline expansion can be
performed later on in the same file, just like macros.
</p>
<p>It’s possible to use <code>defsubst</code> to define a macro to expand
into the same code that an inline function would execute
(see <a href="Macros.html#Macros">Macros</a>).  But the macro would be limited to direct use in
expressions—a macro cannot be called with <code>apply</code>,
<code>mapcar</code> and so on.  Also, it takes some work to convert an
ordinary function into a macro.  To convert it into an inline function
is easy; just replace <code>defun</code> with <code>defsubst</code>.  Since each
argument of an inline function is evaluated exactly once, you needn’t
worry about how many times the body uses the arguments, as you do for
macros.
</p>
<p>As an alternative to <code>defsubst</code>, you can use
<code>define-inline</code> to define functions via their exhaustive compiler
macro.  See <a href="Defining-Functions.html#Defining-Functions">define-inline</a>.
