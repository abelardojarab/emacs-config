<h4 class="subsection">34.2.1 Table of Syntax Classes</h4>

<p><a name="index-syntax-class-table-3471"></a>
  Here is a table of syntax classes, the characters that designate
them, their meanings, and examples of their use.

     <dl>
<dt>Whitespace characters: &lsquo;<samp> </samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Characters that separate symbols and words from each other. 
Typically, whitespace characters have no other syntactic significance,
and multiple whitespace characters are syntactically equivalent to a
single one.  Space, tab, and formfeed are classified as whitespace in
almost all major modes.

     <p>This syntax class can be designated by either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Both designators are equivalent.

     <br><dt>Word constituents: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Parts of words in human languages.  These are typically used in
variable and command names in programs.  All upper- and lower-case
letters, and the digits, are typically word constituents.

     <br><dt>Symbol constituents: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Extra characters used in variable and command names along with word
constituents.  Examples include the characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$&amp;*+-_&lt;&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; in Lisp
mode, which may be part of a symbol name even though they are not part
of English words.  In standard C, the only non-word-constituent
character that is valid in symbols is underscore (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo;).

     <br><dt>Punctuation characters: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Characters used as punctuation in a human language, or used in a
programming language to separate symbols from one another.  Some
programming language modes, such as Emacs Lisp mode, have no
characters in this class since the few characters that are not symbol
or word constituents all have other uses.  Other programming language
modes, such as C mode, use punctuation syntax for operators.

     <br><dt>Open parenthesis characters: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>Close parenthesis characters: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Characters used in dissimilar pairs to surround sentences or
expressions.  Such a grouping is begun with an open parenthesis
character and terminated with a close.  Each open parenthesis
character matches a particular close parenthesis character, and vice
versa.  Normally, Emacs indicates momentarily the matching open
parenthesis when you insert a close parenthesis.  See <a href="Blinking.html#Blinking">Blinking</a>.

     <p>In human languages, and in C code, the parenthesis pairs are
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">()</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{}</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In Emacs Lisp, the delimiters
for lists and vectors (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">()</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo;) are classified as
parenthesis characters.

     <br><dt>String quotes: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Characters used to delimit string constants.  The same string quote
character appears at the beginning and the end of a string.  Such
quoted strings do not nest.

     <p>The parsing facilities of Emacs consider a string as a single token. 
The usual syntactic meanings of the characters in the string are
suppressed.

     <p>The Lisp modes have two string quote characters: double-quote (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo;)
and vertical bar (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;).  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo; is not used in Emacs Lisp, but it
is used in Common Lisp.  C also has two string quote characters:
double-quote for strings, and single-quote (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo;) for character
constants.

     <p>Human text has no string quote characters.  We do not want quotation
marks to turn off the usual syntactic properties of other characters
in the quotation.

     <br><dt>Escape-syntax characters: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Characters that start an escape sequence, such as is used in string
and character constants.  The character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; belongs to this class
in both C and Lisp.  (In C, it is used thus only inside strings, but
it turns out to cause no trouble to treat it this way throughout C
code.)

     <p>Characters in this class count as part of words if
<code>words-include-escapes</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.  See <a href="Word-Motion.html#Word-Motion">Word Motion</a>.

     <br><dt>Character quotes: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Characters used to quote the following character so that it loses its
normal syntactic meaning.  This differs from an escape character in
that only the character immediately following is ever affected.

     <p>Characters in this class count as part of words if
<code>words-include-escapes</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.  See <a href="Word-Motion.html#Word-Motion">Word Motion</a>.

     <p>This class is used for backslash in TeX mode.

     <br><dt>Paired delimiters: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Similar to string quote characters, except that the syntactic
properties of the characters between the delimiters are not
suppressed.  Only TeX mode uses a paired delimiter presently&mdash;the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; that both enters and leaves math mode.

     <br><dt>Expression prefixes: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Characters used for syntactic operators that are considered as part of
an expression if they appear next to one.  In Lisp modes, these
characters include the apostrophe, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo; (used for quoting), the
comma, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo; (used in macros), and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; (used in the read
syntax for certain data types).

     <br><dt>Comment starters: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>Comment enders: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-comment-syntax-3472"></a>Characters used in various languages to delimit comments.  Human text
has no comment characters.  In Lisp, the semicolon (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;) starts a
comment and a newline or formfeed ends one.

     <br><dt>Inherit standard syntax: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This syntax class does not specify a particular syntax.  It says to
look in the standard syntax table to find the syntax of this
character.

     <br><dt>Generic comment delimiters: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Characters that start or end a special kind of comment.  <em>Any</em>
generic comment delimiter matches <em>any</em> generic comment
delimiter, but they cannot match a comment starter or comment ender;
generic comment delimiters can only match each other.

     <p>This syntax class is primarily meant for use with the
<code>syntax-table</code> text property (see <a href="Syntax-Properties.html#Syntax-Properties">Syntax Properties</a>).  You
can mark any range of characters as forming a comment, by giving the
first and last characters of the range <code>syntax-table</code> properties
identifying them as generic comment delimiters.

     <br><dt>Generic string delimiters: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Characters that start or end a string.  This class differs from the
string quote class in that <em>any</em> generic string delimiter can
match any other generic string delimiter; but they do not match
ordinary string quote characters.

     <p>This syntax class is primarily meant for use with the
<code>syntax-table</code> text property (see <a href="Syntax-Properties.html#Syntax-Properties">Syntax Properties</a>).  You
can mark any range of characters as forming a string constant, by
giving the first and last characters of the range <code>syntax-table</code>
properties identifying them as generic string delimiters.
