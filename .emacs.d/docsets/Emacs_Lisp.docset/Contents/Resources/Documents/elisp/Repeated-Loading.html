<h3 class="section">15.6 Repeated Loading</h3>

<p><a name="index-repeated-loading-911"></a>
  You can load a given file more than once in an Emacs session.  For
example, after you have rewritten and reinstalled a function definition
by editing it in a buffer, you may wish to return to the original
version; you can do this by reloading the file it came from.

   <p>When you load or reload files, bear in mind that the <code>load</code> and
<code>load-library</code> functions automatically load a byte-compiled file
rather than a non-compiled file of similar name.  If you rewrite a file
that you intend to save and reinstall, you need to byte-compile the new
version; otherwise Emacs will load the older, byte-compiled file instead
of your newer, non-compiled file!  If that happens, the message
displayed when loading the file includes, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(compiled; note, source is
newer)</span></samp>&rsquo;, to remind you to recompile it.

   <p>When writing the forms in a Lisp library file, keep in mind that the
file might be loaded more than once.  For example, think about whether
each variable should be reinitialized when you reload the library;
<code>defvar</code> does not change the value if the variable is already
initialized.  (See <a href="Defining-Variables.html#Defining-Variables">Defining Variables</a>.)

   <p>The simplest way to add an element to an alist is like this:

<pre class="example">     (push '(leif-mode " Leif") minor-mode-alist)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">But this would add multiple elements if the library is reloaded.  To
avoid the problem, use <code>add-to-list</code> (see <a href="List-Variables.html#List-Variables">List Variables</a>):

<pre class="example">     (add-to-list 'minor-mode-alist '(leif-mode " Leif"))
</pre>
   <p>Occasionally you will want to test explicitly whether a library has
already been loaded.  If the library uses <code>provide</code> to provide a
named feature, you can use <code>featurep</code> earlier in the file to test
whether the <code>provide</code> call has been executed before (see <a href="Named-Features.html#Named-Features">Named Features</a>).  Alternatively, you could use something like this:

<pre class="example">     (defvar foo-was-loaded nil)
     
     (unless foo-was-loaded
       <var>execute-first-time-only</var>
       (setq foo-was-loaded t))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">
