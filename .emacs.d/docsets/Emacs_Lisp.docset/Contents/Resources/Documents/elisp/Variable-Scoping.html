<h3 class="section">11.9 Scoping Rules for Variable Bindings</h3>

<p><a name="index-scoping-rule-649"></a>
  When you create a local binding for a variable, that binding takes
effect only within a limited portion of the program (see <a href="Local-Variables.html#Local-Variables">Local Variables</a>).  This section describes exactly what this means.

   <p><a name="index-scope-650"></a><a name="index-extent-651"></a>  Each local binding has a certain <dfn>scope</dfn> and <dfn>extent</dfn>. 
<dfn>Scope</dfn> refers to <em>where</em> in the textual source code the
binding can be accessed.  <dfn>Extent</dfn> refers to <em>when</em>, as the
program is executing, the binding exists.

   <p><a name="index-dynamic-binding-652"></a><a name="index-dynamic-scope-653"></a><a name="index-dynamic-extent-654"></a>  By default, the local bindings that Emacs creates are <dfn>dynamic
bindings</dfn>.  Such a binding has <dfn>dynamic scope</dfn>, meaning that any
part of the program can potentially access the variable binding.  It
also has <dfn>dynamic extent</dfn>, meaning that the binding lasts only
while the binding construct (such as the body of a <code>let</code> form) is
being executed.

   <p><a name="index-lexical-binding-655"></a><a name="index-lexical-scope-656"></a><a name="index-indefinite-extent-657"></a>  Emacs can optionally create <dfn>lexical bindings</dfn>.  A lexical
binding has <dfn>lexical scope</dfn>, meaning that any reference to the
variable must be located textually within the binding
construct<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  It also has
<dfn>indefinite extent</dfn>, meaning that under some circumstances the
binding can live on even after the binding construct has finished
executing, by means of special objects called <dfn>closures</dfn>.

   <p>The following subsections describe dynamic binding and lexical
binding in greater detail, and how to enable lexical binding in Emacs
Lisp programs.
