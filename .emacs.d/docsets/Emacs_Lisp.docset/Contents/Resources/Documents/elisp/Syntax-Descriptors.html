<h3 class="section">34.2 Syntax Descriptors</h3>

<p><a name="index-syntax-class-3469"></a>
  The <dfn>syntax class</dfn> of a character describes its syntactic role. 
Each syntax table specifies the syntax class of each character.  There
is no necessary relationship between the class of a character in one
syntax table and its class in any other table.

   <p>Each syntax class is designated by a mnemonic character, which
serves as the name of the class when you need to specify a class. 
Usually, this designator character is one that is often assigned that
class; however, its meaning as a designator is unvarying and
independent of what syntax that character currently has.  Thus,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; as a designator character always means &ldquo;escape character&rdquo;
syntax, regardless of whether the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; character actually has that
syntax in the current syntax table. 
See <a href="Syntax-Class-Table.html#Syntax-Class-Table">Syntax Class Table</a>, for a list of syntax classes and their
designator characters.

   <p><a name="index-syntax-descriptor-3470"></a>  A <dfn>syntax descriptor</dfn> is a Lisp string that describes the syntax
class and other syntactic properties of a character.  When you want to
modify the syntax of a character, that is done by calling the function
<code>modify-syntax-entry</code> and passing a syntax descriptor as one of
its arguments (see <a href="Syntax-Table-Functions.html#Syntax-Table-Functions">Syntax Table Functions</a>).

   <p>The first character in a syntax descriptor must be a syntax class
designator character.  The second character, if present, specifies a
matching character (e.g., in Lisp, the matching character for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;); a space specifies that there is no matching
character.  Then come characters specifying additional syntax
properties (see <a href="Syntax-Flags.html#Syntax-Flags">Syntax Flags</a>).

   <p>If no matching character or flags are needed, only one character
(specifying the syntax class) is sufficient.

   <p>For example, the syntax descriptor for the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in C
mode is <code>". 23"</code> (i.e., punctuation, matching character slot
unused, second character of a comment-starter, first character of a
comment-ender), and the entry for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.&nbsp;14<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo; (i.e.,
punctuation, matching character slot unused, first character of a
comment-starter, second character of a comment-ender).

   <p>Emacs also defines <dfn>raw syntax descriptors</dfn>, which are used to
describe syntax classes at a lower level.  See <a href="Syntax-Table-Internals.html#Syntax-Table-Internals">Syntax Table Internals</a>.
