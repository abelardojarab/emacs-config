<h4 class="subsection">24.1.1 Functions for Visiting Files</h4>

<p>This section describes the functions normally used to visit files. 
For historical reasons, these functions have names starting with
‘<samp><span class="samp">find-</span></samp>’ rather than ‘<samp><span class="samp">visit-</span></samp>’.  See <a href="Buffer-File-Name.html#Buffer-File-Name">Buffer File Name</a>, for
functions and variables that access the visited file name of a buffer or
that find an existing buffer by its visited file name.

   </p><p>In a Lisp program, if you want to look at the contents of a file but
not alter it, the fastest way is to use <code>insert-file-contents</code> in a
temporary buffer.  Visiting the file is not necessary and takes longer. 
See <a href="Reading-from-Files.html#Reading-from-Files">Reading from Files</a>.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/find%2Dfile"></a><a name="DASH-2285"></a>— Command: <b>find-file</b><var> filename &amp;optional wildcards<a name="index-find_002dfile-1891"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command selects a buffer visiting the file <var>filename</var>,
using an existing buffer if there is one, and otherwise creating a
new buffer and reading the file into it.  It also returns that buffer.

        </p><p>Aside from some technical details, the body of the <code>find-file</code>
function is basically equivalent to:

     </p><pre class="smallexample">          (switch-to-buffer (find-file-noselect filename nil nil wildcards))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">(See <code>switch-to-buffer</code> in <a href="Switching-Buffers.html#Switching-Buffers">Switching Buffers</a>.)

        </p><p>If <var>wildcards</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, which is always true in an
interactive call, then <code>find-file</code> expands wildcard characters in
<var>filename</var> and visits all the matching files.

        </p><p>When <code>find-file</code> is called interactively, it prompts for
<var>filename</var> in the minibuffer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/find%2Dfile%2Dliterally"></a><a name="DASH-2286"></a>— Command: <b>find-file-literally</b><var> filename<a name="index-find_002dfile_002dliterally-1892"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command visits <var>filename</var>, like <code>find-file</code> does, but it
does not perform any format conversions (see <a href="Format-Conversion.html#Format-Conversion">Format Conversion</a>),
character code conversions (see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>), or end-of-line
conversions (see <a href="Coding-System-Basics.html#Coding-System-Basics">End of line conversion</a>). 
The buffer visiting the file is made unibyte, and its major mode is
Fundamental mode, regardless of the file name.  File local variable
specifications  in the file (see <a href="File-Local-Variables.html#File-Local-Variables">File Local Variables</a>) are
ignored, and automatic decompression and adding a newline at the end
of the file due to <code>require-final-newline</code> (see <a href="Saving-Buffers.html#Saving-Buffers">require-final-newline</a>) are also disabled.

        </p><p>Note that if Emacs already has a buffer visiting the same file
non-literally, it will not visit the same file literally, but instead
just switch to the existing buffer.  If you want to be sure of
accessing a file's contents literally, you should create a temporary
buffer and then read the file contents into it using
<code>insert-file-contents-literally</code> (see <a href="Reading-from-Files.html#Reading-from-Files">Reading from Files</a>). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/find%2Dfile%2Dnoselect"></a><a name="DASH-2287"></a>— Function: <b>find-file-noselect</b><var> filename &amp;optional nowarn rawfile wildcards<a name="index-find_002dfile_002dnoselect-1893"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is the guts of all the file-visiting functions.  It
returns a buffer visiting the file <var>filename</var>.  You may make the
buffer current or display it in a window if you wish, but this
function does not do so.

        </p><p>The function returns an existing buffer if there is one; otherwise it
creates a new buffer and reads the file into it.  When
<code>find-file-noselect</code> uses an existing buffer, it first verifies
that the file has not changed since it was last visited or saved in
that buffer.  If the file has changed, this function asks the user
whether to reread the changed file.  If the user says ‘<samp><span class="samp">yes</span></samp>’, any
edits previously made in the buffer are lost.

        </p><p>Reading the file involves decoding the file's contents (see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>), including end-of-line conversion, and format conversion
(see <a href="Format-Conversion.html#Format-Conversion">Format Conversion</a>).  If <var>wildcards</var> is non-<code>nil</code>,
then <code>find-file-noselect</code> expands wildcard characters in
<var>filename</var> and visits all the matching files.

        </p><p>This function displays warning or advisory messages in various peculiar
cases, unless the optional argument <var>nowarn</var> is non-<code>nil</code>.  For
example, if it needs to create a buffer, and there is no file named
<var>filename</var>, it displays the message ‘<samp><span class="samp">(New file)</span></samp>’ in the echo
area, and leaves the buffer empty.

        </p><p>The <code>find-file-noselect</code> function normally calls
<code>after-find-file</code> after reading the file (see <a href="Subroutines-of-Visiting.html#Subroutines-of-Visiting">Subroutines of Visiting</a>).  That function sets the buffer major mode, parses local
variables, warns the user if there exists an auto-save file more recent
than the file just visited, and finishes by running the functions in
<code>find-file-hook</code>.

        </p><p>If the optional argument <var>rawfile</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then
<code>after-find-file</code> is not called, and the
<code>find-file-not-found-functions</code> are not run in case of failure. 
What's more, a non-<code>nil</code> <var>rawfile</var> value suppresses coding
system conversion and format conversion.

        </p><p>The <code>find-file-noselect</code> function usually returns the buffer that
is visiting the file <var>filename</var>.  But, if wildcards are actually
used and expanded, it returns a list of buffers that are visiting the
various files.

     </p><pre class="example">          (find-file-noselect "/etc/fstab")
               ⇒ #&lt;buffer fstab&gt;
</pre>

<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is a list of functions to be called after a
file is visited.  The file's local-variables specification (if any) will
have been processed before the hooks are run.  The buffer visiting the
file is current when the hook functions are run.

<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is a list of functions to be called when
<code>find-file</code> or <code>find-file-noselect</code> is passed a nonexistent
file name.  <code>find-file-noselect</code> calls these functions as soon as
it detects a nonexistent file.  It calls them in the order of the list,
until one of them returns non-<code>nil</code>.  <code>buffer-file-name</code> is
already set up.

        </p><p>This is not a normal hook because the values of the functions are
used, and in many cases only some of the functions are called.

<blockquote><p>This buffer-local variable, if set to a non-<code>nil</code> value, makes
<code>save-buffer</code> behave as if the buffer were visiting its file
literally, i.e., without conversions of any kind.  The command
<code>find-file-literally</code> sets this variable's local value, but other
equivalent functions and commands can do that as well, e.g., to avoid
automatic addition of a newline at the end of the file.  This variable
is permanent local, so it is unaffected by changes of major modes.
