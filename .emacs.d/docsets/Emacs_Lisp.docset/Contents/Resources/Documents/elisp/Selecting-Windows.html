<p><a name="index-selecting-a-window-2334"></a>

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/select%2Dwindow"></a><a name="DASH-1839"></a>— Function: <b>select-window</b><var> window &amp;optional norecord<a name="index-select_002dwindow-2335"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes <var>window</var> the selected window and the window
selected within its frame (see <a href="Basic-Windows.html#Basic-Windows">Basic Windows</a>) and selects that
frame.  It also makes <var>window</var>'s buffer (see <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html#Buffers-and-Windows">Buffers and Windows</a>) current and sets that buffer's value of <code>point</code> to the
value of <code>window-point</code> (see <a href="Window-Point.html#Window-Point">Window Point</a>) in <var>window</var>. 
<var>window</var> must be a live window.  The return value is <var>window</var>.

        </p><p>By default, this function also moves <var>window</var>'s buffer to the front
of the buffer list (see <a href="Buffer-List.html#Buffer-List">Buffer List</a>), and makes <var>window</var> the
most recently selected window.  However, if the optional argument
<var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, these additional actions are omitted.

        </p><p>This function runs <code>buffer-list-update-hook</code> (see <a href="Buffer-List.html#Buffer-List">Buffer List</a>)
unless <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>.  Note that applications and
internal routines often temporarily select a window in order to simplify
coding.  As a rule, such selections (including those made by the macros
<code>save-selected-window</code> and <code>with-selected-window</code> below) are
not recorded thus avoiding to pollute <code>buffer-list-update-hook</code>. 
Selections that “really count” are those causing a visible change in
the next redisplay of <var>window</var>'s frame and should be always
recorded.  This also means that to run a function each time a window
gets selected, putting it on <code>buffer-list-update-hook</code> should be
the right choice. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-most-recently-selected-windows-2336"></a>  The sequence of calls to <code>select-window</code> with a non-<code>nil</code>
<var>norecord</var> argument determines an ordering of windows by their
selection time.  The function <code>get-lru-window</code> can be used to
retrieve the least recently selected live window (see <a href="Cyclic-Window-Ordering.html#Cyclic-Window-Ordering">Cyclic Window Ordering</a>).

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/macro/save%2Dselected%2Dwindow"></a><a name="DASH-1840"></a>— Macro: <b>save-selected-window</b><var> forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-save_002dselected_002dwindow-2337"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro records the selected frame, as well as the selected window
of each frame, executes <var>forms</var> in sequence, then restores the
earlier selected frame and windows.  It also saves and restores the
current buffer.  It returns the value of the last form in <var>forms</var>.

        </p><p>This macro does not save or restore anything about the sizes,
arrangement or contents of windows; therefore, if <var>forms</var> change
them, the change persists.  If the previously selected window of some
frame is no longer live at the time of exit from <var>forms</var>, that
frame's selected window is left alone.  If the previously selected
window is no longer live, then whatever window is selected at the end of
<var>forms</var> remains selected.  The current buffer is restored if and
only if it is still live when exiting <var>forms</var>.

        </p><p>This macro changes neither the ordering of recently selected windows nor
the buffer list.

<blockquote><p>This macro selects <var>window</var>, executes <var>forms</var> in sequence, then
restores the previously selected window and current buffer.  The ordering
of recently selected windows and the buffer list remain unchanged unless
you deliberately change them within <var>forms</var>; for example, by calling
<code>select-window</code> with argument <var>norecord</var> <code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>This macro does not change the order of recently selected windows or
the buffer list.
