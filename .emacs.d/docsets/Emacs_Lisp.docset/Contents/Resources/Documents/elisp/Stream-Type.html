<h4 class="subsection">2.4.9 Stream Type</h4>

<p>A <em>stream</em> is an object that can be used as a source or sink for
characters&mdash;either to supply characters for input or to accept them as
output.  Many different types can be used this way: markers, buffers,
strings, and functions.  Most often, input streams (character sources)
obtain characters from the keyboard, a buffer, or a file, and output
streams (character sinks) send characters to a buffer, such as a
<samp>*Help*</samp> buffer, or to the echo area.
</p>
<p>The object <code>nil</code>, in addition to its other meanings, may be used
as a stream.  It stands for the value of the variable
<code>standard-input</code> or <code>standard-output</code>.  Also, the object
<code>t</code> as a stream specifies input using the minibuffer
(see <a href="Minibuffers.html#Minibuffers">Minibuffers</a>) or output in the echo area (see <a href="The-Echo-Area.html#The-Echo-Area">The Echo Area</a>).
</p>
<p>Streams have no special printed representation or read syntax, and
print as whatever primitive type they are.
</p>
<p>See <a href="Read-and-Print.html#Read-and-Print">Read and Print</a>, for a description of functions
related to streams, including parsing and printing functions.
