<h3 class="section">29.3 Excursions</h3>
<a name="index-excursion"></a>

<p>It is often useful to move point temporarily within a localized
portion of the program.  This is called an <em>excursion</em>, and it is
done with the <code>save-excursion</code> special form.  This construct
remembers the initial identity of the current buffer, and its value
of point, and restores them after the excursion
completes.  It is the standard way to move point within one part of a
program and avoid affecting the rest of the program, and is used
thousands of times in the Lisp sources of Emacs.
</p>
<p>If you only need to save and restore the identity of the current
buffer, use <code>save-current-buffer</code> or <code>with-current-buffer</code>
instead (see <a href="Current-Buffer.html#Current-Buffer">Current Buffer</a>).  If you need to save or restore
window configurations, see the forms described in <a href="Window-Configurations.html#Window-Configurations">Window Configurations</a> and in <a href="Frame-Configurations.html#Frame-Configurations">Frame Configurations</a>. </p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/save%2Dexcursion"></a><a name="index-save_002dexcursion"></a>Special Form: <strong>save-excursion</strong> <em>body…</em></dt>
<dd><a name="index-point-excursion"></a>
<p>This special form saves the identity of the current buffer and the
value of point in it, evaluates <var>body</var>, and finally
restores the buffer and its saved value of point.  Both saved values are
restored even in case of an abnormal exit via
<code>throw</code> or error (see <a href="Nonlocal-Exits.html#Nonlocal-Exits">Nonlocal Exits</a>).
</p>
<p>The value returned by <code>save-excursion</code> is the result of the last
form in <var>body</var>, or <code>nil</code> if no body forms were given.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Because <code>save-excursion</code> only saves point for the
buffer that was current at the start of the excursion, any changes
made to point in other buffers, during the excursion, will
remain in effect afterward.  This frequently leads to unintended
consequences, so the byte compiler warns if you call <code>set-buffer</code>
during an excursion:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Warning: Use ‘with-current-buffer’ rather than
         save-excursion+set-buffer
</pre></div>

<p>To avoid such problems, you should call <code>save-excursion</code> only
after setting the desired current buffer, as in the following example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun append-string-to-buffer (string buffer)
  "Append STRING to the end of BUFFER."
  (with-current-buffer buffer
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (insert string))))
</pre></div>

<a name="index-window-excursions"></a>
<p>Likewise, <code>save-excursion</code> does not restore window-buffer
correspondences altered by functions such as <code>switch-to-buffer</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Ordinary insertion of text adjacent to the saved
point value relocates the saved value, just as it relocates all
markers.  More precisely, the saved value is a marker with insertion
type <code>nil</code>.  See <a href="Marker-Insertion-Types.html#Marker-Insertion-Types">Marker Insertion Types</a>.  Therefore, when the
saved point value is restored, it normally comes before the inserted
text.
</p>

<dd><a name="index-mark-excursion"></a>
<a name="index-point-excursion-1"></a>
<p>This macro is like <code>save-excursion</code>, but also saves and restores
the mark location and <code>mark-active</code>.  This macro does what
<code>save-excursion</code> did before Emacs 25.1.
