<h5 class="subsubsection">22.6.9.1 Font Lock Multiline</h5>

<p>One way to ensure reliable rehighlighting of multiline Font Lock
constructs is to put on them the text property <code>font-lock-multiline</code>. 
It should be present and non-<code>nil</code> for text that is part of a
multiline construct.

   </p><p>When Font Lock is about to highlight a range of text, it first
extends the boundaries of the range as necessary so that they do not
fall within text marked with the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property. 
Then it removes any <code>font-lock-multiline</code> properties from the
range, and highlights it.  The highlighting specification (mostly
<code>font-lock-keywords</code>) must reinstall this property each time,
whenever it is appropriate.

   </p><p><strong>Warning:</strong> don't use the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property
on large ranges of text, because that will make rehighlighting slow.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/font%2Dlock%2Dmultiline"></a><a name="DASH-927"></a>â€” Variable: <b>font-lock-multiline</b><var><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dmultiline-1811"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> variable is set to <code>t</code>, Font
Lock will try to add the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property
automatically on multiline constructs.  This is not a universal
solution, however, since it slows down Font Lock somewhat.  It can
miss some multiline constructs, or make the property larger or smaller
than necessary.

        </p><p>For elements whose <var>matcher</var> is a function, the function should
ensure that submatch 0 covers the whole relevant multiline construct,
even if only a small subpart will be highlighted.  It is often just as
easy to add the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property by hand. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property is meant to ensure proper
refontification; it does not automatically identify new multiline
constructs.  Identifying the requires that Font Lock mode operate on
large enough chunks at a time.  This will happen by accident on many
cases, which may give the impression that multiline constructs magically
work.  If you set the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> variable
non-<code>nil</code>, this impression will be even stronger, since the
highlighting of those constructs which are found will be properly
updated from then on.  But that does not work reliably.

   </p><p>To find multiline constructs reliably, you must either manually place
the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property on the text before Font Lock
mode looks at it, or use <code>font-lock-fontify-region-function</code>.
