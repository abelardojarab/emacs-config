<h3 class="section">27.20 Textual Scrolling</h3>

<p><a name="index-textual-scrolling-2434"></a><a name="index-scrolling-textually-2435"></a>
  <dfn>Textual scrolling</dfn> means moving the text up or down through a
window.  It works by changing the window's display-start location.  It
may also change the value of <code>window-point</code> to keep point on the
screen (see <a href="Window-Point.html#Window-Point">Window Point</a>).

   </p><p>The basic textual scrolling functions are <code>scroll-up</code> (which
scrolls forward) and <code>scroll-down</code> (which scrolls backward).  In
these function names, “up” and “down” refer to the direction of
motion of the buffer text relative to the window.  Imagine that the
text is written on a long roll of paper and that the scrolling
commands move the paper up and down.  Thus, if you are looking at the
middle of a buffer and repeatedly call <code>scroll-down</code>, you will
eventually see the beginning of the buffer.

   </p><p>Unfortunately, this sometimes causes confusion, because some people
tend to think in terms of the opposite convention: they
imagine the window moving over text that remains in place, so that
“down” commands take you to the end of the buffer.  This convention
is consistent with fact that such a command is bound to a key named
&lt;PageDown&gt; on modern keyboards.

   </p><p>Textual scrolling functions (aside from <code>scroll-other-window</code>)
have unpredictable results if the current buffer is not the one
displayed in the selected window.  See <a href="Current-Buffer.html#Current-Buffer">Current Buffer</a>.

   </p><p>If the window contains a row taller than the height of the window
(for example in the presence of a large image), the scroll functions
will adjust the window's vertical scroll position to scroll the
partially visible row.  Lisp callers can disable this feature by
binding the variable <code>auto-window-vscroll</code> to <code>nil</code>
(see <a href="Vertical-Scrolling.html#Vertical-Scrolling">Vertical Scrolling</a>).

<blockquote><p>This function scrolls the text in another window upward <var>count</var>
lines.  Negative values of <var>count</var>, or <code>nil</code>, are handled
as in <code>scroll-up</code>.

        </p><p>You can specify which buffer to scroll by setting the variable
<code>other-window-scroll-buffer</code> to a buffer.  If that buffer isn't
already displayed, <code>scroll-other-window</code> displays it in some
window.

        </p><p>When the selected window is the minibuffer, the next window is normally
the leftmost one immediately above it.  You can specify a different
window to scroll, when the minibuffer is selected, by setting the variable
<code>minibuffer-scroll-window</code>.  This variable has no effect when any
other window is selected.  When it is non-<code>nil</code> and the
minibuffer is selected, it takes precedence over
<code>other-window-scroll-buffer</code>.  See <a href="Definition-of-minibuffer_002dscroll_002dwindow.html#Definition-of-minibuffer_002dscroll_002dwindow">Definition of minibuffer-scroll-window</a>.

        </p><p>When the minibuffer is active, it is the next window if the selected
window is the one at the bottom right corner.  In this case,
<code>scroll-other-window</code> attempts to scroll the minibuffer.  If the
minibuffer contains just one line, it has nowhere to scroll to, so the
line reappears after the echo area momentarily displays the message
‘<samp><span class="samp">End of buffer</span></samp>’.

<blockquote><p>This variable controls how scrolling is done automatically when point
moves off the screen (or into the scroll margin).  If the value is a
positive integer <var>n</var>, then redisplay scrolls the text up to
<var>n</var> lines in either direction, if that will bring point back into

Otherwise, scrolling happens in the usual way, under the control of

<blockquote><p>The value of this variable should be either <code>nil</code> or a fraction
<var>f</var> between 0 and 1.  If it is a fraction, that specifies where on
the screen to put point when scrolling down.  More precisely, when a

start position is chosen to put point <var>f</var> part of the window
height from the top.  The larger <var>f</var>, the more aggressive the
scrolling.

point.  This variable automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any

<blockquote><p><a name="index-centering-point-2452"></a>This function scrolls the text in the selected window so that point is
displayed at a specified vertical position within the window.  It does
not “move point” with respect to the text.

        </p><p>If <var>count</var> is a non-negative number, that puts the line containing
point <var>count</var> lines down from the top of the window.  If
<var>count</var> is a negative number, then it counts upward from the
bottom of the window, so that −1 stands for the last usable
line in the window.

        </p><p>If <var>count</var> is <code>nil</code> (or a non-<code>nil</code> list),
<code>recenter</code> puts the line containing point in the middle of the
window.  If <var>count</var> is <code>nil</code>, this function may redraw the
frame, according to the value of <code>recenter-redisplay</code>.

        </p><p>When <code>recenter</code> is called interactively, <var>count</var> is the raw
prefix argument.  Thus, typing <kbd>C-u</kbd> as the prefix sets the
<var>count</var> to a non-<code>nil</code> list, while typing <kbd>C-u 4</kbd> sets
<var>count</var> to 4, which positions the current line four lines from the
top.

        </p><p>With an argument of zero, <code>recenter</code> positions the current line at
the top of the window.  The command <code>recenter-top-bottom</code> offers
a more convenient way to achieve this.
