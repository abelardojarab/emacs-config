<h3 class="section">36.5 Deleting Processes</h3>
<a name="index-deleting-processes"></a>

<p><em>Deleting a process</em> disconnects Emacs immediately from the
subprocess.  Processes are deleted automatically after they terminate,
but not necessarily right away.  You can delete a process explicitly
at any time.  If you explicitly delete a terminated process before it
is deleted automatically, no harm results.  Deleting a running
process sends a signal to terminate it (and its child processes, if
any), and calls the process sentinel.  See <a href="Sentinels.html#Sentinels">Sentinels</a>.
</p>
<p>When a process is deleted, the process object itself continues to
exist as long as other Lisp objects point to it.  All the Lisp
primitives that work on process objects accept deleted processes, but
those that do I/O or send signals will report an error.  The process
mark continues to point to the same place as before, usually into a
buffer where output from the process was being inserted.

<dd><p>This variable controls automatic deletion of processes that have
terminated (due to calling <code>exit</code> or to a signal).  If it is
<code>nil</code>, then they continue to exist until the user runs
<code>list-processes</code>.  Otherwise, they are deleted immediately after
they exit.

<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/delete%2Dprocess"></a><a name="index-delete_002dprocess"></a>Function: <strong>delete-process</strong> <em>process</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function deletes a process, killing it with a <code>SIGKILL</code>
signal if the process was running a program.  The argument may be a
process, the name of a process, a buffer, or the name of a buffer.  (A
buffer or buffer-name stands for the process that
<code>get-buffer-process</code> returns.)  Calling <code>delete-process</code> on
a running process terminates it, updates the process status, and runs
the sentinel immediately.  If the process has already terminated,
calling <code>delete-process</code> has no effect on its status, or on the
running of its sentinel (which will happen sooner or later).
</p>
<p>If the process object represents a network, serial, or pipe
connection, its status changes to <code>closed</code>; otherwise, it changes
to <code>signal</code>, unless the process already exited.  See <a href="Process-Information.html#Process-Information">process-status</a>.
