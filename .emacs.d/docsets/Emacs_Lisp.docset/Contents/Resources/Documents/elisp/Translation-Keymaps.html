<h3 class="section">21.14 Keymaps for Translating Sequences of Events</h3>

<p><a name="index-translation-keymap-1624"></a><a name="index-keymaps-for-translating-events-1625"></a>
  When the <code>read-key-sequence</code> function reads a key sequence
(see <a href="Key-Sequence-Input.html#Key-Sequence-Input">Key Sequence Input</a>), it uses <dfn>translation keymaps</dfn> to
translate certain event sequences into others.  The translation
keymaps are <code>input-decode-map</code>, <code>local-function-key-map</code>,
and <code>key-translation-map</code> (in order of priority).

   </p><p>Translation keymaps have the same structure as other keymaps, but
are used differently: they specify translations to make while reading
key sequences, rather than bindings for complete key sequences.  As
each key sequence is read, it is checked against each translation
keymap.  If one of the translation keymaps “binds” <var>k</var> to a
vector <var>v</var>, then whenever <var>k</var> appears as a sub-sequence
<em>anywhere</em> in a key sequence, that sub-sequence is replaced with
the events in <var>v</var>.

   </p><p>For example, VT100 terminals send <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; O P</kbd> when the
keypad key &lt;PF1&gt; is pressed.  On such terminals, Emacs must
translate that sequence of events into a single event <code>pf1</code>. 
This is done by “binding” <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; O P</kbd> to <code>[pf1]</code> in
<code>input-decode-map</code>.  Thus, when you type <kbd>C-c &lt;PF1&gt;</kbd> on
the terminal, the terminal emits the character sequence <kbd>C-c
&lt;ESC&gt; O P</kbd>, and <code>read-key-sequence</code> translates this back into
<kbd>C-c &lt;PF1&gt;</kbd> and returns it as the vector <code>[?\C-c pf1]</code>.

   </p><p>Translation keymaps take effect only after Emacs has decoded the
keyboard input (via the input coding system specified by
<code>keyboard-coding-system</code>).  See <a href="Terminal-I_002fO-Encoding.html#Terminal-I_002fO-Encoding">Terminal I/O Encoding</a>.

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/input%2Ddecode%2Dmap"></a><a name="DASH-2205"></a>— Variable: <b>input-decode-map</b><var><a name="index-input_002ddecode_002dmap-1626"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable holds a keymap that describes the character sequences sent
by function keys on an ordinary character terminal.

        </p><p>The value of <code>input-decode-map</code> is usually set up automatically
according to the terminal's Terminfo or Termcap entry, but sometimes
those need help from terminal-specific Lisp files.  Emacs comes with
terminal-specific files for many common terminals; their main purpose is
to make entries in <code>input-decode-map</code> beyond those that can be
deduced from Termcap and Terminfo.  See <a href="Terminal_002dSpecific.html#Terminal_002dSpecific">Terminal-Specific</a>.

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/local%2Dfunction%2Dkey%2Dmap"></a><a name="DASH-2206"></a>— Variable: <b>local-function-key-map</b><var><a name="index-local_002dfunction_002dkey_002dmap-1627"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable holds a keymap similar to <code>input-decode-map</code> except
that it describes key sequences which should be translated to
alternative interpretations that are usually preferred.  It applies
after <code>input-decode-map</code> and before <code>key-translation-map</code>.

        </p><p>Entries in <code>local-function-key-map</code> are ignored if they conflict
with bindings made in the minor mode, local, or global keymaps.  I.e.,
the remapping only applies if the original key sequence would
otherwise not have any binding.

        </p><p><code>local-function-key-map</code> inherits from <code>function-key-map</code>,
but the latter should not be used directly. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/key%2Dtranslation%2Dmap"></a><a name="DASH-2207"></a>— Variable: <b>key-translation-map</b><var><a name="index-key_002dtranslation_002dmap-1628"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable is another keymap used just like <code>input-decode-map</code>
to translate input events into other events.  It differs from
<code>input-decode-map</code> in that it goes to work after
<code>local-function-key-map</code> is finished rather than before; it
receives the results of translation by <code>local-function-key-map</code>.

        </p><p>Just like <code>input-decode-map</code>, but unlike
<code>local-function-key-map</code>, this keymap is applied regardless of
whether the input key-sequence has a normal binding.  Note however
that actual key bindings can have an effect on
<code>key-translation-map</code>, even though they are overridden by it. 
Indeed, actual key bindings override <code>local-function-key-map</code> and
thus may alter the key sequence that <code>key-translation-map</code>
receives.  Clearly, it is better to avoid this type of situation.

        </p><p>The intent of <code>key-translation-map</code> is for users to map one
character set to another, including ordinary characters normally bound
to <code>self-insert-command</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-key-translation-function-1629"></a>You can use <code>input-decode-map</code>, <code>local-function-key-map</code>,
and <code>key-translation-map</code> for more than simple aliases, by using
a function, instead of a key sequence, as the “translation” of a
key.  Then this function is called to compute the translation of that
key.

   </p><p>The key translation function receives one argument, which is the prompt
that was specified in <code>read-key-sequence</code>—or <code>nil</code> if the
key sequence is being read by the editor command loop.  In most cases
you can ignore the prompt value.

   </p><p>If the function reads input itself, it can have the effect of altering
the event that follows.  For example, here's how to define <kbd>C-c h</kbd>
to turn the character that follows into a Hyper character:

</p><pre class="example">     (defun hyperify (prompt)
       (let ((e (read-event)))
         (vector (if (numberp e)
                     (logior (lsh 1 24) e)
                   (if (memq 'hyper (event-modifiers e))
                       e
                     (add-event-modifier "H-" e))))))
     
     (defun add-event-modifier (string e)
       (let ((symbol (if (symbolp e) e (car e))))
         (setq symbol (intern (concat string
                                      (symbol-name symbol))))
         (if (symbolp e)
             symbol
           (cons symbol (cdr e)))))
     
     (define-key local-function-key-map "\C-ch" 'hyperify)
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">21.14.1 Interaction with normal keymaps</h4>

<p>The end of a key sequence is detected when that key sequence either is bound
to a command, or when Emacs determines that no additional event can lead
to a sequence that is bound to a command.

   </p><p>This means that, while <code>input-decode-map</code> and <code>key-translation-map</code>
apply regardless of whether the original key sequence would have a binding, the
presence of such a binding can still prevent translation from taking place. 
For example, let us return to our VT100 example above and add a binding for
<kbd>C-c &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> to the global map; now when the user hits <kbd>C-c
&lt;PF1&gt;</kbd> Emacs will fail to decode <kbd>C-c &lt;ESC&gt; O P</kbd> into <kbd>C-c
&lt;PF1&gt;</kbd> because it will stop reading keys right after <kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>,
leaving <kbd>O P</kbd> for later.  This is in case the user really hit <kbd>C-c
&lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>, in which case Emacs should not sit there waiting for the next key
to decide whether the user really pressed <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>&lt;PF1&gt;</kbd>.

   </p><p>For that reason, it is better to avoid binding commands to key sequences where
the end of the key sequence is a prefix of a key translation.  The main such
problematic suffixes/prefixes are <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>M-O</kbd> (which is really
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; O</kbd>) and <kbd>M-[</kbd> (which is really <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; [</kbd>).
