<h3 class="section">27.16 Window History</h3>
<a name="index-window-history"></a>

<p>Each window remembers in a list the buffers it has previously displayed,
and the order in which these buffers were removed from it.  This history
is used, for example, by <code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code>
(see <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html#Buffers-and-Windows">Buffers and Windows</a>).  The list is automatically maintained by
Emacs, but you can use the following functions to explicitly inspect or
alter it:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/window%2Dprev%2Dbuffers"></a><a name="index-window_002dprev_002dbuffers"></a>Function: <strong>window-prev-buffers</strong> <em>&amp;optional window</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns a list specifying the previous contents of
<var>window</var>.  The optional argument <var>window</var> should be a live
window and defaults to the selected one.
</p>
<p>Each list element has the form <code>(<var>buffer</var> <var>window-start</var>
<var>window-pos</var>)</code>, where <var>buffer</var> is a buffer previously shown in
the window, <var>window-start</var> is the window start position
(see <a href="Window-Start-and-End.html#Window-Start-and-End">Window Start and End</a>) when that buffer was last shown, and
<var>window-pos</var> is the point position (see <a href="Window-Point.html#Window-Point">Window Point</a>) when
that buffer was last shown in <var>window</var>.
</p>
<p>The list is ordered so that earlier elements correspond to more
recently-shown buffers, and the first element usually corresponds to the
buffer most recently removed from the window.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/set%2Dwindow%2Dprev%2Dbuffers"></a><a name="index-set_002dwindow_002dprev_002dbuffers"></a>Function: <strong>set-window-prev-buffers</strong> <em>window prev-buffers</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function sets <var>window</var>’s previous buffers to the value of
<var>prev-buffers</var>.  The argument <var>window</var> must be a live window
and defaults to the selected one.  The argument <var>prev-buffers</var>
should be a list of the same form as that returned by
<code>window-prev-buffers</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>In addition, each buffer maintains a list of <em>next buffers</em>, which
is a list of buffers re-shown by <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> (see
below).  This list is mainly used by <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> and
<code>switch-to-next-buffer</code> for choosing buffers to switch to.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/window%2Dnext%2Dbuffers"></a><a name="index-window_002dnext_002dbuffers"></a>Function: <strong>window-next-buffers</strong> <em>&amp;optional window</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the list of buffers recently re-shown in
<var>window</var> via <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code>.  The <var>window</var>
argument must denote a live window or <code>nil</code> (meaning the selected
window).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/set%2Dwindow%2Dnext%2Dbuffers"></a><a name="index-set_002dwindow_002dnext_002dbuffers"></a>Function: <strong>set-window-next-buffers</strong> <em>window next-buffers</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function sets the next buffer list of <var>window</var> to
<var>next-buffers</var>.  The <var>window</var> argument should be a live window
or <code>nil</code> (meaning the selected window).  The argument
<var>next-buffers</var> should be a list of buffers.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The following commands can be used to cycle through the global buffer
list, much like <code>bury-buffer</code> and <code>unbury-buffer</code>.  However,
they cycle according to the specified window’s history list, rather
than the global buffer list.  In addition, they restore
window-specific window start and point positions, and may show a
buffer even if it is already shown in another window.  The
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> command, in particular, is used by
<code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code>, <code>bury-buffer</code> and
<code>quit-window</code> to find a replacement buffer for a window.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/switch%2Dto%2Dprev%2Dbuffer"></a><a name="index-switch_002dto_002dprev_002dbuffer"></a>Command: <strong>switch-to-prev-buffer</strong> <em>&amp;optional window bury-or-kill</em></dt>
<dd><p>This command displays the previous buffer in <var>window</var>.  The
argument <var>window</var> should be a live window or <code>nil</code> (meaning
the selected window).  If the optional argument <var>bury-or-kill</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, this means that the buffer currently shown in
<var>window</var> is about to be buried or killed and consequently should
not be switched to in future invocations of this command.
</p>
<p>The previous buffer is usually the buffer shown before the buffer
currently shown in <var>window</var>.  However, a buffer that has been buried
or killed, or has been already shown by a recent invocation of
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code>, does not qualify as previous buffer.
</p>
<p>If repeated invocations of this command have already shown all buffers
previously shown in <var>window</var>, further invocations will show buffers
from the buffer list of the frame <var>window</var> appears on (see <a href="Buffer-List.html#Buffer-List">Buffer List</a>), trying to skip buffers that are already shown in another window
on that frame.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/switch%2Dto%2Dnext%2Dbuffer"></a><a name="index-switch_002dto_002dnext_002dbuffer"></a>Command: <strong>switch-to-next-buffer</strong> <em>&amp;optional window</em></dt>
<dd><p>This command switches to the next buffer in <var>window</var>, thus undoing
the effect of the last <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> command in
<var>window</var>.  The argument <var>window</var> must be a live window and
defaults to the selected one.
</p>
<p>If there is no recent invocation of <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> that
can be undone, this function tries to show a buffer from the buffer list
of the frame <var>window</var> appears on (see <a href="Buffer-List.html#Buffer-List">Buffer List</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<p>By default <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> and <code>switch-to-next-buffer</code>
can switch to a buffer that is already shown in another window on the
same frame.  The following option can be used to override this behavior.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/switch%2Dto%2Dvisible%2Dbuffer"></a><a name="index-switch_002dto_002dvisible_002dbuffer"></a>User Option: <strong>switch-to-visible-buffer</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> and
<code>switch-to-next-buffer</code> may switch to a buffer that is already
visible on the same frame, provided the buffer was shown in the
relevant window before.  If it is <code>nil</code>,
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> and <code>switch-to-next-buffer</code> always
try to avoid switching to a buffer that is already visible in another
window on the same frame.  The default is <code>t</code>.
