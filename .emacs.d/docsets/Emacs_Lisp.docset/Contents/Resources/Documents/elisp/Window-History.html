<h3 class="section">27.15 Window History</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-history-2403"></a>
Each window remembers in a list the buffers it has previously displayed,
and the order in which these buffers were removed from it.  This history
is used, for example, by <code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code>
(see <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html#Buffers-and-Windows">Buffers and Windows</a>).  The list is automatically maintained by
Emacs, but you can use the following functions to explicitly inspect or
alter it:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/window%2Dprev%2Dbuffers"></a><a name="DASH-2326"></a>— Function: <b>window-prev-buffers</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dprev_002dbuffers-2404"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a list specifying the previous contents of
<var>window</var>.  The optional argument <var>window</var> should be a live
window and defaults to the selected one.

        </p><p>Each list element has the form <code>(</code><var>buffer</var> <var>window-start</var>
<var>window-pos</var><code>)</code>, where <var>buffer</var> is a buffer previously shown in
the window, <var>window-start</var> is the window start position
(see <a href="Window-Start-and-End.html#Window-Start-and-End">Window Start and End</a>) when that buffer was last shown, and
<var>window-pos</var> is the point position (see <a href="Window-Point.html#Window-Point">Window Point</a>) when
that buffer was last shown in <var>window</var>.

        </p><p>The list is ordered so that earlier elements correspond to more
recently-shown buffers, and the first element usually corresponds to the
buffer most recently removed from the window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/set%2Dwindow%2Dprev%2Dbuffers"></a><a name="DASH-2327"></a>— Function: <b>set-window-prev-buffers</b><var> window prev-buffers<a name="index-set_002dwindow_002dprev_002dbuffers-2405"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sets <var>window</var>'s previous buffers to the value of
<var>prev-buffers</var>.  The argument <var>window</var> must be a live window
and defaults to the selected one.  The argument <var>prev-buffers</var>
should be a list of the same form as that returned by
<code>window-prev-buffers</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>In addition, each buffer maintains a list of <dfn>next buffers</dfn>, which
is a list of buffers re-shown by <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> (see
below).  This list is mainly used by <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> and
<code>switch-to-next-buffer</code> for choosing buffers to switch to.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/window%2Dnext%2Dbuffers"></a><a name="DASH-2328"></a>— Function: <b>window-next-buffers</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dnext_002dbuffers-2406"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the list of buffers recently re-shown in
<var>window</var> via <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code>.  The <var>window</var>
argument must denote a live window or <code>nil</code> (meaning the selected
window). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/set%2Dwindow%2Dnext%2Dbuffers"></a><a name="DASH-2329"></a>— Function: <b>set-window-next-buffers</b><var> window next-buffers<a name="index-set_002dwindow_002dnext_002dbuffers-2407"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sets the next buffer list of <var>window</var> to
<var>next-buffers</var>.  The <var>window</var> argument should be a live window
or <code>nil</code> (meaning the selected window).  The argument
<var>next-buffers</var> should be a list of buffers. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The following commands can be used to cycle through the global buffer
list, much like <code>bury-buffer</code> and <code>unbury-buffer</code>.  However,
they cycle according to the specified window's history list, rather
than the global buffer list.  In addition, they restore
window-specific window start and point positions, and may show a
buffer even if it is already shown in another window.  The
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> command, in particular, is used by
<code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code>, <code>bury-buffer</code> and
<code>quit-window</code> to find a replacement buffer for a window.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/switch%2Dto%2Dprev%2Dbuffer"></a><a name="DASH-2330"></a>— Command: <b>switch-to-prev-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional window bury-or-kill<a name="index-switch_002dto_002dprev_002dbuffer-2408"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command displays the previous buffer in <var>window</var>.  The
argument <var>window</var> should be a live window or <code>nil</code> (meaning
the selected window).  If the optional argument <var>bury-or-kill</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, this means that the buffer currently shown in
<var>window</var> is about to be buried or killed and consequently should
not be switched to in future invocations of this command.

        </p><p>The previous buffer is usually the buffer shown before the buffer
currently shown in <var>window</var>.  However, a buffer that has been buried
or killed, or has been already shown by a recent invocation of
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code>, does not qualify as previous buffer.

        </p><p>If repeated invocations of this command have already shown all buffers
previously shown in <var>window</var>, further invocations will show buffers
from the buffer list of the frame <var>window</var> appears on (see <a href="Buffer-List.html#Buffer-List">Buffer List</a>), trying to skip buffers that are already shown in another window
on that frame. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/switch%2Dto%2Dnext%2Dbuffer"></a><a name="DASH-2331"></a>— Command: <b>switch-to-next-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-switch_002dto_002dnext_002dbuffer-2409"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command switches to the next buffer in <var>window</var>, thus undoing
the effect of the last <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> command in
<var>window</var>.  The argument <var>window</var> must be a live window and
defaults to the selected one.

        </p><p>If there is no recent invocation of <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> that
can be undone, this function tries to show a buffer from the buffer list
of the frame <var>window</var> appears on (see <a href="Buffer-List.html#Buffer-List">Buffer List</a>). 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>By default <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> and <code>switch-to-next-buffer</code>
can switch to a buffer that is already shown in another window on the
same frame.  The following option can be used to override this behavior.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/switch%2Dto%2Dvisible%2Dbuffer"></a><a name="DASH-2332"></a>— User Option: <b>switch-to-visible-buffer</b><var><a name="index-switch_002dto_002dvisible_002dbuffer-2410"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> and
<code>switch-to-next-buffer</code> may switch to a buffer that is already
visible on the same frame, provided the buffer was shown in the
relevant window before.  If it is <code>nil</code>,
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> and <code>switch-to-next-buffer</code> always
try to avoid switching to a buffer that is already visible in another
window on the same frame.  The default is <code>t</code>.
