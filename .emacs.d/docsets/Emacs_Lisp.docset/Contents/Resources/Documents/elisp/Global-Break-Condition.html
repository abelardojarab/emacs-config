<h5 class="subsubsection">17.2.6.2 Global Break Condition</h5>

<p><a name="index-stopping-on-events-1016"></a><a name="index-global-break-condition-1017"></a>  A <dfn>global break condition</dfn> stops execution when a specified
condition is satisfied, no matter where that may occur.  Edebug
evaluates the global break condition at every stop point; if it
evaluates to a non-<code>nil</code> value, then execution stops or pauses
depending on the execution mode, as if a breakpoint had been hit.  If
evaluating the condition gets an error, execution does not stop.

   <p><a name="index-edebug_002dset_002dglobal_002dbreak_002dcondition-1018"></a>  The condition expression is stored in
<code>edebug-global-break-condition</code>.  You can specify a new expression
using the <kbd>X</kbd> command from the source code buffer while Edebug is
active, or using <kbd>C-x X X</kbd> from any buffer at any time, as long as
Edebug is loaded (<code>edebug-set-global-break-condition</code>).

   <p>The global break condition is the simplest way to find where in your
code some event occurs, but it makes code run much more slowly.  So you
should reset the condition to <code>nil</code> when not using it.
