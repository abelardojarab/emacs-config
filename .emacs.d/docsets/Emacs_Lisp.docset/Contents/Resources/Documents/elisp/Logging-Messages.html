<h4 class="subsection">37.4.3 Logging Messages in <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp></h4>

<p><a name="index-logging-echo_002darea-messages-3758"></a>
  Almost all the messages displayed in the echo area are also recorded
in the <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> buffer so that the user can refer back to
them.  This includes all the messages that are output with
<code>message</code>.  By default, this buffer is read-only and uses the major
mode <code>messages-buffer-mode</code>.  Nothing prevents the user from
killing the <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> buffer, but the next display of a message
recreates it.  Any Lisp code that needs to access the
<samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> buffer directly and wants to ensure that it exists
should use the function <code>messages-buffer</code>.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/messages%2Dbuffer"></a><a name="DASH-1249"></a>— Function: <b>messages-buffer</b><var><a name="index-messages_002dbuffer-3759"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> buffer.  If it does not
exist, it creates it, and switches it to <code>messages-buffer-mode</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/message%2Dlog%2Dmax"></a><a name="DASH-1250"></a>— User Option: <b>message-log-max</b><var><a name="index-message_002dlog_002dmax-3760"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable specifies how many lines to keep in the <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp>
buffer.  The value <code>t</code> means there is no limit on how many lines to
keep.  The value <code>nil</code> disables message logging entirely.  Here's
how to display a message and prevent it from being logged:

     </p><pre class="example">          (let (message-log-max)
            (message ...))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>To make <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> more convenient for the user, the logging
facility combines successive identical messages.  It also combines
successive related messages for the sake of two cases: question
followed by answer, and a series of progress messages.

   </p><p>A “question followed by an answer” means two messages like the
ones produced by <code>y-or-n-p</code>: the first is ‘<samp><var>question</var></samp>’,
and the second is ‘<samp><var>question</var><span class="samp">...</span><var>answer</var></samp>’.  The first
message conveys no additional information beyond what's in the second,
so logging the second message discards the first from the log.

   </p><p>A “series of progress messages” means successive messages like
those produced by <code>make-progress-reporter</code>.  They have the form
‘<samp><var>base</var><span class="samp">...</span><var>how-far</var></samp>’, where <var>base</var> is the same each
time, while <var>how-far</var> varies.  Logging each message in the series
discards the previous one, provided they are consecutive.

   </p><p>The functions <code>make-progress-reporter</code> and <code>y-or-n-p</code>
don't have to do anything special to activate the message log
combination feature.  It operates whenever two consecutive messages
are logged that share a common prefix ending in ‘<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>’.
