<h4 class="subsection">24.12.3 Piecemeal Specification</h4>

<p>In contrast to the round-trip specification described in the previous
subsection (see <a href="Format-Conversion-Round_002dTrip.html#Format-Conversion-Round_002dTrip">Format Conversion Round-Trip</a>), you can use the variables
<code>after-insert-file-functions</code> and <code>write-region-annotate-functions</code>
to separately control the respective reading and writing conversions.

   </p><p>Conversion starts with one representation and produces another
representation.  When there is only one conversion to do, there is no
conflict about what to start with.  However, when there are multiple
conversions involved, conflict may arise when two conversions need to
start with the same data.

   </p><p>This situation is best understood in the context of converting text
properties during <code>write-region</code>.  For example, the character at
position 42 in a buffer is ‘<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>’ with a text property <code>foo</code>.  If
the conversion for <code>foo</code> is done by inserting into the buffer, say,
‘<samp><span class="samp">FOO:</span></samp>’, then that changes the character at position 42 from
‘<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>’ to ‘<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>’.  The next conversion will start with the wrong
data straight away.

   </p><p>To avoid conflict, cooperative conversions do not modify the buffer,
but instead specify <dfn>annotations</dfn>, a list of elements of the form
<code>(</code><var>position</var><code> . </code><var>string</var><code>)</code>, sorted in order of increasing
<var>position</var>.

   </p><p>If there is more than one conversion, <code>write-region</code> merges their
annotations destructively into one sorted list.  Later, when the text
from the buffer is actually written to the file, it intermixes the
specified annotations at the corresponding positions.  All this takes
place without modifying the buffer.

<!-- ??? What about ``overriding'' conversions like those allowed -->
<!-- ??? for `write-region-annotate-functions', below?  -ttn -->
   </p><p>In contrast, when reading, the annotations intermixed with the text
are handled immediately.  <code>insert-file-contents</code> sets point to
the beginning of some text to be converted, then calls the conversion
functions with the length of that text.  These functions should always
return with point at the beginning of the inserted text.  This
approach makes sense for reading because annotations removed by the
first converter can't be mistakenly processed by a later converter. 
Each conversion function should scan for the annotations it
recognizes, remove the annotation, modify the buffer text (to set a
text property, for example), and return the updated length of the
text, as it stands after those changes.  The value returned by one
function becomes the argument to the next function.

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/write%2Dregion%2Dannotate%2Dfunctions"></a><a name="DASH-943"></a>— Variable: <b>write-region-annotate-functions</b><var><a name="index-write_002dregion_002dannotate_002dfunctions-2085"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A list of functions for <code>write-region</code> to call.  Each function in
the list is called with two arguments: the start and end of the region
to be written.  These functions should not alter the contents of the
buffer.  Instead, they should return annotations.

        </p><p>As a special case, a function may return with a different buffer
current.  Emacs takes this to mean that the current buffer contains
altered text to be output.  It therefore changes the <var>start</var> and
<var>end</var> arguments of the <code>write-region</code> call, giving them the
values of <code>point-min</code> and <code>point-max</code> in the new buffer,
respectively.  It also discards all previous annotations, because they
should have been dealt with by this function. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/write%2Dregion%2Dpost%2Dannotation%2Dfunction"></a><a name="DASH-944"></a>— Variable: <b>write-region-post-annotation-function</b><var><a name="index-write_002dregion_002dpost_002dannotation_002dfunction-2086"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable, if non-<code>nil</code>, should be a function. 
This function is called, with no arguments, after <code>write-region</code>
has completed.

        </p><p>If any function in <code>write-region-annotate-functions</code> returns with
a different buffer current, Emacs calls
<code>write-region-post-annotation-function</code> more than once.  Emacs
calls it with the last buffer that was current, and again with the
buffer before that, and so on back to the original buffer.

        </p><p>Thus, a function in <code>write-region-annotate-functions</code> can create
a buffer, give this variable the local value of <code>kill-buffer</code> in
that buffer, set up the buffer with altered text, and make the buffer
current.  The buffer will be killed after <code>write-region</code> is done.

<blockquote><p>Each function in this list is called by <code>insert-file-contents</code>
with one argument, the number of characters inserted, and with point
at the beginning of the inserted text.  Each function should leave
point unchanged, and return the new character count describing the
inserted text as modified by the function.

   <p>We invite users to write Lisp programs to store and retrieve text
properties in files, using these hooks, and thus to experiment with
various data formats and find good ones.  Eventually we hope users
will produce good, general extensions we can install in Emacs.

   </p><p>We suggest not trying to handle arbitrary Lisp objects as text property
names or values—because a program that general is probably difficult
to write, and slow.  Instead, choose a set of possible data types that
are reasonably flexible, and not too hard to encode.
