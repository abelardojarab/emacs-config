<h4 class="subsection">13.5.2 Evaluating Macro Arguments Repeatedly</h4>

<p>When defining a macro you must pay attention to the number of times
the arguments will be evaluated when the expansion is executed.  The
following macro (used to facilitate iteration) illustrates the
problem.  This macro allows us to write a &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop construct.

   <p><a name="index-for-818"></a>
<pre class="example">     (defmacro for (var from init to final do &amp;rest body)
       "Execute a simple \"for\" loop.
     For example, (for i from 1 to 10 do (print i))."
       (list 'let (list (list var init))
             (cons 'while
                   (cons (list '&lt;= var final)
                         (append body (list (list 'inc var)))))))
     
     (for i from 1 to 3 do
        (setq square (* i i))
        (princ (format "\n%d %d" i square)))
     ==&gt;
     (let ((i 1))
       (while (&lt;= i 3)
         (setq square (* i i))
         (princ (format "\n%d %d" i square))
         (inc i)))
     
          -|1       1
          -|2       4
          -|3       9
     &rArr; nil
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The arguments <code>from</code>, <code>to</code>, and <code>do</code> in this macro are
&ldquo;syntactic sugar&rdquo;; they are entirely ignored.  The idea is that you
will write noise words (such as <code>from</code>, <code>to</code>, and <code>do</code>)
in those positions in the macro call.

   <p>Here's an equivalent definition simplified through use of backquote:

<pre class="example">     (defmacro for (var from init to final do &amp;rest body)
       "Execute a simple \"for\" loop.
     For example, (for i from 1 to 10 do (print i))."
       `(let ((,var ,init))
          (while (&lt;= ,var ,final)
            ,@body
            (inc ,var))))
</pre>
   <p>Both forms of this definition (with backquote and without) suffer from
the defect that <var>final</var> is evaluated on every iteration.  If
<var>final</var> is a constant, this is not a problem.  If it is a more
complex form, say <code>(long-complex-calculation x)</code>, this can slow
down the execution significantly.  If <var>final</var> has side effects,
executing it more than once is probably incorrect.

   <p><a name="index-macro-argument-evaluation-819"></a>A well-designed macro definition takes steps to avoid this problem by
producing an expansion that evaluates the argument expressions exactly
once unless repeated evaluation is part of the intended purpose of the
macro.  Here is a correct expansion for the <code>for</code> macro:

<pre class="example">     (let ((i 1)
           (max 3))
       (while (&lt;= i max)
         (setq square (* i i))
         (princ (format "%d      %d" i square))
         (inc i)))
</pre>
   <p>Here is a macro definition that creates this expansion:

<pre class="example">     (defmacro for (var from init to final do &amp;rest body)
       "Execute a simple for loop: (for i from 1 to 10 do (print i))."
       `(let ((,var ,init)
              (max ,final))
          (while (&lt;= ,var max)
            ,@body
            (inc ,var))))
</pre>
   <p>Unfortunately, this fix introduces another problem,
described in the following section.
