<h3 class="section">4.7 Formatting Strings</h3>
<a name="index-formatting-strings"></a>
<a name="index-strings_002c-formatting-them"></a>

<p><em>Formatting</em> means constructing a string by substituting
computed values at various places in a constant string.  This constant
string controls how the other values are printed, as well as where
they appear; it is called a <em>format string</em>.
</p>
<p>Formatting is often useful for computing messages to be displayed.  In
fact, the functions <code>message</code> and <code>error</code> provide the same
formatting feature described here; they differ from <code>format-message</code> only
in how they use the result of formatting.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/format"></a><a name="index-format"></a>Function: <strong>format</strong> <em>string &amp;rest objects</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns a new string that is made by copying
<var>string</var> and then replacing any format specification
in the copy with encodings of the corresponding <var>objects</var>.  The
arguments <var>objects</var> are the computed values to be formatted.
</p>
<p>The characters in <var>string</var>, other than the format specifications,
are copied directly into the output, including their text properties,
if any.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/format%2Dmessage"></a><a name="index-format_002dmessage"></a>Function: <strong>format-message</strong> <em>string &amp;rest objects</em></dt>
<dd><a name="index-curved-quotes"></a>
<a name="index-curly-quotes"></a>
<p>This function acts like <code>format</code>, except it also converts any
curved single quotes in <var>string</var> as per the value of
<code>text-quoting-style</code>, and treats grave accent (<tt>`</tt>) and
apostrophe (<tt>'</tt>) as if they were curved single quotes.
</p>
<p>A format that quotes with grave accents and apostrophes <tt>`like
this'</tt> typically generates curved quotes <tt>‘like this’</tt>.  In
contrast, a format that quotes with only apostrophes <tt>'like this'</tt>
typically generates two closing curved quotes <tt>’like this’</tt>, an
unusual style in English.  See <a href="Keys-in-Documentation.html#Keys-in-Documentation">Keys in Documentation</a>, for how the
<code>text-quoting-style</code> variable affects generated quotes.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="index-_0025-in-format"></a>
<a name="index-format-specification"></a>
<p>A format specification is a sequence of characters beginning with a
‘<samp>%</samp>’.  Thus, if there is a ‘<samp>%d</samp>’ in <var>string</var>, the
<code>format</code> function replaces it with the printed representation of
one of the values to be formatted (one of the arguments <var>objects</var>).
For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(format "The value of fill-column is %d." fill-column)
     ⇒ "The value of fill-column is 72."
</pre></div>

<p>Since <code>format</code> interprets ‘<samp>%</samp>’ characters as format
specifications, you should <em>never</em> pass an arbitrary string as
the first argument.  This is particularly true when the string is
generated by some Lisp code.  Unless the string is <em>known</em> to
never include any ‘<samp>%</samp>’ characters, pass <code>"%s"</code>, described
below, as the first argument, and the string as the second, like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  (format "%s" <var>arbitrary-string</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>If <var>string</var> contains more than one format specification, the
format specifications correspond to successive values from
<var>objects</var>.  Thus, the first format specification in <var>string</var>
uses the first such value, the second format specification uses the
second such value, and so on.  Any extra format specifications (those
for which there are no corresponding values) cause an error.  Any
extra values to be formatted are ignored.
</p>
<p>Certain format specifications require values of particular types.  If
you supply a value that doesn’t fit the requirements, an error is
signaled.
</p>
<p>Here is a table of valid format specifications:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>%s</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Replace the specification with the printed representation of the object,
made without quoting (that is, using <code>princ</code>, not
<code>prin1</code>—see <a href="Output-Functions.html#Output-Functions">Output Functions</a>).  Thus, strings are represented
by their contents alone, with no ‘<samp>"</samp>’ characters, and symbols appear
without ‘<samp>\</samp>’ characters.
</p>
<p>If the object is a string, its text properties are
copied into the output.  The text properties of the ‘<samp>%s</samp>’ itself
are also copied, but those of the object take priority.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>%S</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Replace the specification with the printed representation of the object,
made with quoting (that is, using <code>prin1</code>—see <a href="Output-Functions.html#Output-Functions">Output Functions</a>).  Thus, strings are enclosed in ‘<samp>"</samp>’ characters, and
‘<samp>\</samp>’ characters appear where necessary before special characters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>%o</samp>’</dt>
<dd><a name="index-integer-to-octal"></a>
<p>Replace the specification with the base-eight representation of an
integer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>%d</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Replace the specification with the base-ten representation of an
integer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>%x</samp>’</dt>
<dt>‘<samp>%X</samp>’</dt>
<dd><a name="index-integer-to-hexadecimal"></a>
<p>Replace the specification with the base-sixteen representation of an
integer.  ‘<samp>%x</samp>’ uses lower case and ‘<samp>%X</samp>’ uses upper case.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>%c</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Replace the specification with the character which is the value given.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>%e</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Replace the specification with the exponential notation for a
floating-point number.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>%f</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Replace the specification with the decimal-point notation for a
floating-point number.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>%g</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Replace the specification with notation for a floating-point number,
using either exponential notation or decimal-point notation, whichever
is shorter.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>%%</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Replace the specification with a single ‘<samp>%</samp>’.  This format
specification is unusual in that it does not use a value.  For example,
<code>(format "%% %d" 30)</code> returns <code>"% 30"</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Any other format character results in an ‘<samp>Invalid format
operation</samp>’ error.
</p>
<p>Here are several examples, which assume the typical
<code>text-quoting-style</code> settings:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(format "The octal value of %d is %o,
         and the hex value is %x." 18 18 18)
     ⇒ "The octal value of 18 is 22,
         and the hex value is 12."

(format-message
 "The name of this buffer is ‘%s’." (buffer-name))
     ⇒ "The name of this buffer is ‘strings.texi’."

(format-message
 "The buffer object prints as `%s'." (current-buffer))
     ⇒ "The buffer object prints as ‘strings.texi’."
</pre></div>

<a name="index-field-width"></a>
<a name="index-padding"></a>
<p>A specification can have a <em>width</em>, which is a decimal number
between the ‘<samp>%</samp>’ and the specification character.  If the printed
representation of the object contains fewer characters than this
width, <code>format</code> extends it with padding.  The width specifier is
ignored for the ‘<samp>%%</samp>’ specification.  Any padding introduced by
the width specifier normally consists of spaces inserted on the left:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(format "%5d is padded on the left with spaces" 123)
     ⇒ "  123 is padded on the left with spaces"
</pre></div>

<p>If the width is too small, <code>format</code> does not truncate the
object’s printed representation.  Thus, you can use a width to specify
a minimum spacing between columns with no risk of losing information.
In the following two examples, ‘<samp>%7s</samp>’ specifies a minimum width
of 7.  In the first case, the string inserted in place of ‘<samp>%7s</samp>’
has only 3 letters, and needs 4 blank spaces as padding.  In the
second case, the string <code>"specification"</code> is 13 letters wide but
is not truncated.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(format "The word '%7s' has %d letters in it."
        "foo" (length "foo"))
     ⇒ "The word '    foo' has 3 letters in it."
(format "The word '%7s' has %d letters in it."
        "specification" (length "specification"))
     ⇒ "The word 'specification' has 13 letters in it."
</pre></div>

<a name="index-flags-in-format-specifications"></a>
<p>Immediately after the ‘<samp>%</samp>’ and before the optional width
specifier, you can also put certain <em>flag characters</em>.
</p>
<p>The flag ‘<samp>+</samp>’ inserts a plus sign before a positive number, so
that it always has a sign.  A space character as flag inserts a space
before a positive number.  (Otherwise, positive numbers start with the
first digit.)  These flags are useful for ensuring that positive
numbers and negative numbers use the same number of columns.  They are
ignored except for ‘<samp>%d</samp>’, ‘<samp>%e</samp>’, ‘<samp>%f</samp>’, ‘<samp>%g</samp>’, and if
both flags are used, ‘<samp>+</samp>’ takes precedence.
</p>
<p>The flag ‘<samp>#</samp>’ specifies an alternate form which depends on
the format in use.  For ‘<samp>%o</samp>’, it ensures that the result begins
with a ‘<samp>0</samp>’.  For ‘<samp>%x</samp>’ and ‘<samp>%X</samp>’, it prefixes the result
with ‘<samp>0x</samp>’ or ‘<samp>0X</samp>’.  For ‘<samp>%e</samp>’, ‘<samp>%f</samp>’, and ‘<samp>%g</samp>’,
the ‘<samp>#</samp>’ flag means include a decimal point even if the precision
is zero.
</p>
<p>The flag ‘<samp>0</samp>’ ensures that the padding consists of ‘<samp>0</samp>’
characters instead of spaces.  This flag is ignored for non-numerical
specification characters like ‘<samp>%s</samp>’, ‘<samp>%S</samp>’ and ‘<samp>%c</samp>’.
These specification characters accept the ‘<samp>0</samp>’ flag, but still pad
with <em>spaces</em>.
</p>
<p>The flag ‘<samp>-</samp>’ causes the padding inserted by the width
specifier, if any, to be inserted on the right rather than the left.
If both ‘<samp>-</samp>’ and ‘<samp>0</samp>’ are present, the ‘<samp>0</samp>’ flag is
ignored.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(format "%06d is padded on the left with zeros" 123)
     ⇒ "000123 is padded on the left with zeros"

(format "'%-6d' is padded on the right" 123)
     ⇒ "'123   ' is padded on the right"

(format "The word '%-7s' actually has %d letters in it."
        "foo" (length "foo"))
     ⇒ "The word 'foo    ' actually has 3 letters in it."
</pre></div>

<a name="index-precision-in-format-specifications"></a>
<p>All the specification characters allow an optional <em>precision</em>
before the character (after the width, if present).  The precision is
a decimal-point ‘<samp>.</samp>’ followed by a digit-string.  For the
floating-point specifications (‘<samp>%e</samp>’, ‘<samp>%f</samp>’, ‘<samp>%g</samp>’), the
precision specifies how many decimal places to show; if zero, the
decimal-point itself is also omitted.  For ‘<samp>%s</samp>’ and ‘<samp>%S</samp>’,
the precision truncates the string to the given width, so ‘<samp>%.3s</samp>’
shows only the first three characters of the representation for
<var>object</var>.  For other specification characters, the effect of
precision is what the local library functions of the <code>printf</code>
family produce.
