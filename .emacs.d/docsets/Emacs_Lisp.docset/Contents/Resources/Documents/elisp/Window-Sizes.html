   <p><a name="index-window-body-2257"></a><a name="index-text-area-of-a-window-2258"></a><a name="index-body-of-a-window-2259"></a>  At the center of the window is the <dfn>text area</dfn>, or <dfn>body</dfn>,
where the buffer text is displayed.  The text area can be surrounded by
a series of optional areas.  On the left and right, from innermost to
outermost, these are the left and right margins, denoted by LM and RM in
the schematic (see <a href="Display-Margins.html#Display-Margins">Display Margins</a>); the left and right fringes,
denoted by LF and RF (see <a href="Fringes.html#Fringes">Fringes</a>); the left or right scroll bar,
only one of which is present at any time, denoted by LS and RS
(see <a href="Scroll-Bars.html#Scroll-Bars">Scroll Bars</a>); and the right divider, denoted by RD
(see <a href="Window-Dividers.html#Window-Dividers">Window Dividers</a>).  At the top of the window is the header line
(see <a href="Header-Lines.html#Header-Lines">Header Lines</a>); at the bottom of the window is the mode line
(see <a href="Mode-Line-Format.html#Mode-Line-Format">Mode Line Format</a>) followed by the bottom divider (see <a href="Window-Dividers.html#Window-Dividers">Window Dividers</a>).

   </p><p>Emacs provides miscellaneous functions for finding the height and
width of a window.  The return value of many of these functions can be
specified either in units of pixels or in units of lines and columns. 
On a graphical display, the latter actually correspond to the height and
width of a “default” character specified by the frame's default font
as returned by <code>frame-char-height</code> and <code>frame-char-width</code>
(see <a href="Size-and-Position.html#Size-and-Position">Size and Position</a>).  Thus, if a window is displaying text with
a different font or size, the reported line height and column width for
that window may differ from the actual number of text lines or columns
displayed within it.

   </p><p><a name="index-window-height-2260"></a><a name="index-height-of-a-window-2261"></a><a name="index-total-height-of-a-window-2262"></a>  The <dfn>total height</dfn> of a window is the number of lines comprising
the window's body, the header line, the mode line and the bottom divider
(if any).  Note that the height of a frame is not the same as the height
of its root window (see <a href="Windows-and-Frames.html#Windows-and-Frames">Windows and Frames</a>), since a frame may also
contain an echo area, a menu bar, and a tool bar (see <a href="Size-and-Position.html#Size-and-Position">Size and Position</a>).

</p><div class="defun">

<var>window</var>.  If <var>window</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, it defaults to
the selected window.  If <var>window</var> is an internal window, the return
value is the total height occupied by its descendant windows.

        </p><p>If a window's pixel height is not an integral multiple of its frame's
default character height, the number of lines occupied by the window is
rounded internally.  This is done in a way such that, if the window is a
parent window, the sum of the total heights of all its child windows
internally equals the total height of their parent.  This means that
although two windows have the same pixel height, their internal total
heights may differ by one line.  This means also, that if this window is
vertically combined and has a right sibling, the topmost row of that
sibling can be calculated as the sum of this window's topmost row and
total height (see <a href="Coordinates-and-Windows.html#Coordinates-and-Windows">Coordinates and Windows</a>)

        </p><p>If the optional argument <var>round</var> is <code>ceiling</code>, this
function returns the smallest integer larger than <var>window</var>'s pixel
height divided by the character height of its frame; if it is
<code>floor</code>, it returns the largest integer smaller than said value;
with any other <var>round</var> it returns the internal value of
<var>windows</var>'s total height.
