<h4 class="subsubsection">2.3.6.3 Association List Type</h4>

<p>An <em>association list</em> or <em>alist</em> is a specially-constructed
list whose elements are cons cells.  In each element, the <small>CAR</small> is
considered a <em>key</em>, and the <small>CDR</small> is considered an
<em>associated value</em>.  (In some cases, the associated value is stored
in the <small>CAR</small> of the <small>CDR</small>.)  Association lists are often used as
stacks, since it is easy to add or remove associations at the front of
the list.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq alist-of-colors
      '((rose . red) (lily . white) (buttercup . yellow)))
</pre></div>

<p>sets the variable <code>alist-of-colors</code> to an alist of three elements.  In the
first element, <code>rose</code> is the key and <code>red</code> is the value.
</p>
<p>See <a href="Association-Lists.html#Association-Lists">Association Lists</a>, for a further explanation of alists and for
functions that work on alists.  See <a href="Hash-Tables.html#Hash-Tables">Hash Tables</a>, for another kind of
lookup table, which is much faster for handling a large number of keys.
