<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.6.3 Association List Type</h5>

<p>An <dfn>association list</dfn> or <dfn>alist</dfn> is a specially-constructed
list whose elements are cons cells.  In each element, the <span class="sc">car</span> is
considered a <dfn>key</dfn>, and the <span class="sc">cdr</span> is considered an
<dfn>associated value</dfn>.  (In some cases, the associated value is stored
in the <span class="sc">car</span> of the <span class="sc">cdr</span>.)  Association lists are often used as
stacks, since it is easy to add or remove associations at the front of
the list.

   <p>For example,

<pre class="example">     (setq alist-of-colors
           '((rose . red) (lily . white) (buttercup . yellow)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">sets the variable <code>alist-of-colors</code> to an alist of three elements.  In the
first element, <code>rose</code> is the key and <code>red</code> is the value.

   <p>See <a href="Association-Lists.html#Association-Lists">Association Lists</a>, for a further explanation of alists and for
functions that work on alists.  See <a href="Hash-Tables.html#Hash-Tables">Hash Tables</a>, for another kind of
lookup table, which is much faster for handling a large number of keys.
