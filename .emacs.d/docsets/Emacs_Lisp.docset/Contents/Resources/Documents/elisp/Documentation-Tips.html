<h3 class="section">D.6 Tips for Documentation Strings</h3>

<p><a name="index-documentation-strings_002c-conventions-and-tips-4389"></a>
<a name="index-checkdoc_002dminor_002dmode-4390"></a>  Here are some tips and conventions for the writing of documentation
strings.  You can check many of these conventions by running the command
<kbd>M-x checkdoc-minor-mode</kbd>.

     <ul>
<li>Every command, function, or variable intended for users to know about
should have a documentation string.

     <li>An internal variable or subroutine of a Lisp program might as well
have a documentation string.  Documentation strings take up very
little space in a running Emacs.

     <li>Format the documentation string so that it fits in an Emacs window on an
80-column screen.  It is a good idea for most lines to be no wider than
60 characters.  The first line should not be wider than 67 characters
or it will look bad in the output of <code>apropos</code>.

     <p><a name="index-emacs_002dlisp_002ddocstring_002dfill_002dcolumn-4391"></a>You can fill the text if that looks good.  Emacs Lisp mode fills
documentation strings to the width specified by
<code>emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column</code>.  However, you can sometimes
make a documentation string much more readable by adjusting its line
breaks with care.  Use blank lines between sections if the
documentation string is long.

     <li>The first line of the documentation string should consist of one or two
complete sentences that stand on their own as a summary.  <kbd>M-x
apropos</kbd> displays just the first line, and if that line's contents don't
stand on their own, the result looks bad.  In particular, start the
first line with a capital letter and end it with a period.

     <p>For a function, the first line should briefly answer the question,
&ldquo;What does this function do?&rdquo;  For a variable, the first line should
briefly answer the question, &ldquo;What does this value mean?&rdquo;

     <p>Don't limit the documentation string to one line; use as many lines as
you need to explain the details of how to use the function or
variable.  Please use complete sentences for the rest of the text too.

     <li>When the user tries to use a disabled command, Emacs displays just the
first paragraph of its documentation string&mdash;everything through the
first blank line.  If you wish, you can choose which information to
include before the first blank line so as to make this display useful.

     <li>The first line should mention all the important arguments of the
function, and should mention them in the order that they are written
in a function call.  If the function has many arguments, then it is
not feasible to mention them all in the first line; in that case, the
first line should mention the first few arguments, including the most
important arguments.

     <li>When a function's documentation string mentions the value of an argument
of the function, use the argument name in capital letters as if it were
a name for that value.  Thus, the documentation string of the function
<code>eval</code> refers to its first argument as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FORM</span></samp>&rsquo;, because the
actual argument name is <code>form</code>:

     <pre class="example">          Evaluate FORM and return its value.
</pre>
     <p>Also write metasyntactic variables in capital letters, such as when you
show the decomposition of a list or vector into subunits, some of which
may vary.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">KEY</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VALUE</span></samp>&rsquo; in the following example
illustrate this practice:

     <pre class="example">          The argument TABLE should be an alist whose elements
          have the form (KEY . VALUE).  Here, KEY is ...
</pre>
     <li>Never change the case of a Lisp symbol when you mention it in a doc
string.  If the symbol's name is <code>foo</code>, write &ldquo;foo&rdquo;, not
&ldquo;Foo&rdquo; (which is a different symbol).

     <p>This might appear to contradict the policy of writing function
argument values, but there is no real contradiction; the argument
<em>value</em> is not the same thing as the <em>symbol</em> that the
function uses to hold the value.

     <p>If this puts a lower-case letter at the beginning of a sentence
and that annoys you, rewrite the sentence so that the symbol
is not at the start of it.

     <li>Do not start or end a documentation string with whitespace.

     <li><strong>Do not</strong> indent subsequent lines of a documentation string so
that the text is lined up in the source code with the text of the first
line.  This looks nice in the source code, but looks bizarre when users
view the documentation.  Remember that the indentation before the
starting double-quote is not part of the string!

     <p><a name="Docstring-hyperlinks"></a><li>When a documentation string refers to a Lisp symbol, write it as it
would be printed (which usually means in lower case), with single-quotes
around it.  For example: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lambda</span></samp>&rsquo;.  There are two exceptions: write
t and nil without single-quotes.  (In this manual, we use a different
convention, with single-quotes for all symbols.)

     <p><a name="index-hyperlinks-in-documentation-strings-4392"></a>Help mode automatically creates a hyperlink when a documentation string
uses a symbol name inside single quotes, if the symbol has either a
function or a variable definition.  You do not need to do anything
special to make use of this feature.  However, when a symbol has both a
function definition and a variable definition, and you want to refer to
just one of them, you can specify which one by writing one of the words
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">variable</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">option</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">function</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">command</span></samp>&rsquo;,
immediately before the symbol name.  (Case makes no difference in
recognizing these indicator words.)  For example, if you write

     <pre class="example">          This function sets the variable `buffer-file-name'.
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">then the hyperlink will refer only to the variable documentation of
<code>buffer-file-name</code>, and not to its function documentation.

     <p>If a symbol has a function definition and/or a variable definition, but
those are irrelevant to the use of the symbol that you are documenting,
you can write the words &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">symbol</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">program</span></samp>&rsquo; before the
symbol name to prevent making any hyperlink.  For example,

     <pre class="example">          If the argument KIND-OF-RESULT is the symbol `list',
          this function returns a list of all the objects
          that satisfy the criterion.
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">does not make a hyperlink to the documentation, irrelevant here, of the
function <code>list</code>.

     <p>Normally, no hyperlink is made for a variable without variable
documentation.  You can force a hyperlink for such variables by
preceding them with one of the words &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">variable</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">option</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>Hyperlinks for faces are only made if the face name is preceded or
followed by the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">face</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In that case, only the face
documentation will be shown, even if the symbol is also defined as a
variable or as a function.

     <p>To make a hyperlink to Info documentation, write the name of the Info
node (or anchor) in single quotes, preceded by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info node</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Info node</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info anchor</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Info anchor</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The Info
file name defaults to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">emacs</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          See Info node `Font Lock' and Info node `(elisp)Font Lock Basics'.
</pre>
     <p>Finally, to create a hyperlink to URLs, write the URL in single
quotes, preceded by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">URL</span></samp>&rsquo;. For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          The home page for the GNU project has more information (see URL
          `http://www.gnu.org/').
</pre>
     <li>Don't write key sequences directly in documentation strings.  Instead,
use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\[...]</span></samp>&rsquo; construct to stand for them.  For example,
instead of writing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-f</span></samp>&rsquo;, write the construct
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\[forward-char]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  When Emacs displays the documentation string,
it substitutes whatever key is currently bound to <code>forward-char</code>. 
(This is normally &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-f</span></samp>&rsquo;, but it may be some other character if the
user has moved key bindings.)  See <a href="Keys-in-Documentation.html#Keys-in-Documentation">Keys in Documentation</a>.

     <li>In documentation strings for a major mode, you will want to refer to the
key bindings of that mode's local map, rather than global ones. 
Therefore, use the construct &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\&lt;...&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; once in the
documentation string to specify which key map to use.  Do this before
the first use of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\[...]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The text inside the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\&lt;...&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; should be the name of the variable containing the
local keymap for the major mode.

     <p>It is not practical to use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\[...]</span></samp>&rsquo; very many times, because
display of the documentation string will become slow.  So use this to
describe the most important commands in your major mode, and then use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\{...}</span></samp>&rsquo; to display the rest of the mode's keymap.

     <li>For consistency, phrase the verb in the first sentence of a function's
documentation string as an imperative&mdash;for instance, use &ldquo;Return the
cons of A and B.&rdquo; in preference to &ldquo;Returns the cons of A and B.&rdquo;
Usually it looks good to do likewise for the rest of the first
paragraph.  Subsequent paragraphs usually look better if each sentence
is indicative and has a proper subject.

     <li>The documentation string for a function that is a yes-or-no predicate
should start with words such as &ldquo;Return t if&rdquo;, to indicate
explicitly what constitutes &ldquo;truth&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;return&rdquo; avoids
starting the sentence with lower-case &ldquo;t&rdquo;, which could be somewhat
distracting.

     <li>If a line in a documentation string begins with an open-parenthesis,
write a backslash before the open-parenthesis, like this:

     <pre class="example">          The argument FOO can be either a number
          \(a buffer position) or a string (a file name).
</pre>
     <p>This prevents the open-parenthesis from being treated as the start of a
defun (see <a href="../emacs/Defuns.html#Defuns">Defuns</a>).

     <li>Write documentation strings in the active voice, not the passive, and in
the present tense, not the future.  For instance, use &ldquo;Return a list
containing A and B.&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;A list containing A and B will be
returned.&rdquo;

     <li>Avoid using the word &ldquo;cause&rdquo; (or its equivalents) unnecessarily. 
Instead of, &ldquo;Cause Emacs to display text in boldface&rdquo;, write just
&ldquo;Display text in boldface&rdquo;.

     <li>Avoid using &ldquo;iff&rdquo; (a mathematics term meaning &ldquo;if and only if&rdquo;),
since many people are unfamiliar with it and mistake it for a typo.  In
most cases, the meaning is clear with just &ldquo;if&rdquo;.  Otherwise, try to
find an alternate phrasing that conveys the meaning.

     <li>When a command is meaningful only in a certain mode or situation,
do mention that in the documentation string.  For example,
the documentation of <code>dired-find-file</code> is:

     <pre class="example">          In Dired, visit the file or directory named on this line.
</pre>
     <li>When you define a variable that represents an option users might want
to set, use <code>defcustom</code>.  See <a href="Defining-Variables.html#Defining-Variables">Defining Variables</a>.

     <li>The documentation string for a variable that is a yes-or-no flag should
start with words such as &ldquo;Non-nil means&rdquo;, to make it clear that
all non-<code>nil</code> values are equivalent and indicate explicitly what
<code>nil</code> and non-<code>nil</code> mean. 
</ul>
