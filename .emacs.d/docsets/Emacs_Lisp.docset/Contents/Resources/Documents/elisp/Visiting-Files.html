<p>Visiting a file means reading a file into a buffer.  Once this is
done, we say that the buffer is <em>visiting</em> that file, and call the
file <em>the visited file</em> of the buffer.
</p>
<p>A file and a buffer are two different things.  A file is information
recorded permanently in the computer (unless you delete it).  A
buffer, on the other hand, is information inside of Emacs that will
vanish at the end of the editing session (or when you kill the
buffer).  When a buffer is visiting a file, it contains information
copied from the file.  The copy in the buffer is what you modify with
editing commands.  Changes to the buffer do not change the file; to
make the changes permanent, you must <em>save</em> the buffer, which
means copying the altered buffer contents back into the file.
</p>
<p>Despite the distinction between files and buffers, people often
refer to a file when they mean a buffer and vice-versa.  Indeed, we
say, &ldquo;I am editing a file&rdquo;, rather than, &ldquo;I am editing a buffer
that I will soon save as a file of the same name&rdquo;.  Humans do not
usually need to make the distinction explicit.  When dealing with a
computer program, however, it is good to keep the distinction in mind.
