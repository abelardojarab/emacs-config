<h4 class="subsection">11.10.1 Introduction to Buffer-Local Variables</h4>

<p>A buffer-local variable has a buffer-local binding associated with a
particular buffer.  The binding is in effect when that buffer is
current; otherwise, it is not in effect.  If you set the variable while
a buffer-local binding is in effect, the new value goes in that binding,
so its other bindings are unchanged.  This means that the change is
visible only in the buffer where you made it.

   <p>The variable's ordinary binding, which is not associated with any
specific buffer, is called the <dfn>default binding</dfn>.  In most cases,
this is the global binding.

   <p>A variable can have buffer-local bindings in some buffers but not in
other buffers.  The default binding is shared by all the buffers that
don't have their own bindings for the variable.  (This includes all
newly-created buffers.)  If you set the variable in a buffer that does
not have a buffer-local binding for it, this sets the default binding,
so the new value is visible in all the buffers that see the default
binding.

   <p>The most common use of buffer-local bindings is for major modes to change
variables that control the behavior of commands.  For example, C mode and
Lisp mode both set the variable <code>paragraph-start</code> to specify that only
blank lines separate paragraphs.  They do this by making the variable
buffer-local in the buffer that is being put into C mode or Lisp mode, and
then setting it to the new value for that mode.  See <a href="Major-Modes.html#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>.

   <p>The usual way to make a buffer-local binding is with
<code>make-local-variable</code>, which is what major mode commands typically
use.  This affects just the current buffer; all other buffers (including
those yet to be created) will continue to share the default value unless
they are explicitly given their own buffer-local bindings.

   <p><a name="index-automatically-buffer_002dlocal-667"></a>  A more powerful operation is to mark the variable as
<dfn>automatically buffer-local</dfn> by calling
<code>make-variable-buffer-local</code>.  You can think of this as making the
variable local in all buffers, even those yet to be created.  More
precisely, the effect is that setting the variable automatically makes
the variable local to the current buffer if it is not already so.  All
buffers start out by sharing the default value of the variable as usual,
but setting the variable creates a buffer-local binding for the current
buffer.  The new value is stored in the buffer-local binding, leaving
the default binding untouched.  This means that the default value cannot
be changed with <code>setq</code> in any buffer; the only way to change it is
with <code>setq-default</code>.

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> When a variable has buffer-local
bindings in one or more buffers, <code>let</code> rebinds the binding that's
currently in effect.  For instance, if the current buffer has a
buffer-local value, <code>let</code> temporarily rebinds that.  If no
buffer-local bindings are in effect, <code>let</code> rebinds
the default value.  If inside the <code>let</code> you then change to a
different current buffer in which a different binding is in effect,
you won't see the <code>let</code> binding any more.  And if you exit the
<code>let</code> while still in the other buffer, you won't see the
unbinding occur (though it will occur properly).  Here is an example
to illustrate:

<pre class="example">     (setq foo 'g)
     (set-buffer "a")
     (make-local-variable 'foo)
     (setq foo 'a)
     (let ((foo 'temp))
       ;; foo &rArr; 'temp  ; <span class="roman">let binding in buffer &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;</span>
       (set-buffer "b")
       ;; foo &rArr; 'g     ; <span class="roman">the global value since foo is not local in &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;</span>
       <var>body</var>...)
     foo &rArr; 'g        ; <span class="roman">exiting restored the local value in buffer &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;,</span>
                      ; <span class="roman">but we don't see that in buffer &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;</span>
     (set-buffer "a") ; <span class="roman">verify the local value was restored</span>
     foo &rArr; 'a
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that references to <code>foo</code> in <var>body</var> access the
buffer-local binding of buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>When a file specifies local variable values, these become buffer-local
values when you visit the file.  See <a href="../emacs/File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>.

   <p>A buffer-local variable cannot be made terminal-local
(see <a href="Multiple-Terminals.html#Multiple-Terminals">Multiple Terminals</a>).
