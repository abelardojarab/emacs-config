<h4 class="subsection">20.7.9 Focus Events</h4>
<a name="index-focus-event"></a>

<p>Window systems provide general ways for the user to control which window
gets keyboard input.  This choice of window is called the <em>focus</em>.
When the user does something to switch between Emacs frames, that
generates a <em>focus event</em>.  The normal definition of a focus event,
in the global keymap, is to select a new frame within Emacs, as the user
would expect.  See <a href="Input-Focus.html#Input-Focus">Input Focus</a>, which also describes hooks related
to focus events.
</p>
<p>Focus events are represented in Lisp as lists that look like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(switch-frame <var>new-frame</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>where <var>new-frame</var> is the frame switched to.
</p>
<p>Some X window managers are set up so that just moving the mouse into a
window is enough to set the focus there.  Usually, there is no need
for a Lisp program to know about the focus change until some other
kind of input arrives.  Emacs generates a focus event only when the
user actually types a keyboard key or presses a mouse button in the
new frame; just moving the mouse between frames does not generate a
focus event.
</p>
<p>A focus event in the middle of a key sequence would garble the
sequence.  So Emacs never generates a focus event in the middle of a key
sequence.  If the user changes focus in the middle of a key
sequence&mdash;that is, after a prefix key&mdash;then Emacs reorders the events
so that the focus event comes either before or after the multi-event key
sequence, and not within it.
