<h4 class="subsection">2.3.6 Cons Cell and List Types</h4>

<p><a name="index-address-field-of-register-89"></a><a name="index-decrement-field-of-register-90"></a><a name="index-pointers-91"></a>
  A <dfn>cons cell</dfn> is an object that consists of two slots, called
the <span class="sc">car</span> slot and the <span class="sc">cdr</span> slot.  Each slot can <dfn>hold</dfn> any
Lisp object.  We also say that &ldquo;the <span class="sc">car</span> of this cons cell is&rdquo;
whatever object its <span class="sc">car</span> slot currently holds, and likewise for
the <span class="sc">cdr</span>.

   <p><a name="index-list-structure-92"></a>  A <dfn>list</dfn> is a series of cons cells, linked together so that the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> slot of each cons cell holds either the next cons cell or the
empty list.  The empty list is actually the symbol <code>nil</code>. 
See <a href="Lists.html#Lists">Lists</a>, for details.  Because most cons cells are used as part
of lists, we refer to any structure made out of cons cells as a
<dfn>list structure</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-linked-list-93"></a><blockquote>
A note to C programmers: a Lisp list thus works as a <dfn>linked list</dfn>
built up of cons cells.  Because pointers in Lisp are implicit, we do
not distinguish between a cons cell slot &ldquo;holding&rdquo; a value versus
&ldquo;pointing to&rdquo; the value. 
</blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-atoms-94"></a>  Because cons cells are so central to Lisp, we also have a word for
&ldquo;an object which is not a cons cell&rdquo;.  These objects are called
<dfn>atoms</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-parenthesis-95"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0028_0040dots_007b_007d_0029_007d-in-lists-96"></a>  The read syntax and printed representation for lists are identical, and
consist of a left parenthesis, an arbitrary number of elements, and a
right parenthesis.  Here are examples of lists:

<pre class="example">     (A 2 "A")            ; <span class="roman">A list of three elements.</span>
     ()                   ; <span class="roman">A list of no elements (the empty list).</span>
     nil                  ; <span class="roman">A list of no elements (the empty list).</span>
     ("A ()")             ; <span class="roman">A list of one element: the string </span><code>"A ()"</code><span class="roman">.</span>
     (A ())               ; <span class="roman">A list of two elements: </span><code>A</code><span class="roman"> and the empty list.</span>
     (A nil)              ; <span class="roman">Equivalent to the previous.</span>
     ((A B C))            ; <span class="roman">A list of one element</span>
                          ;   <span class="roman">(which is a list of three elements).</span>
</pre>
   <p>Upon reading, each object inside the parentheses becomes an element
of the list.  That is, a cons cell is made for each element.  The
<span class="sc">car</span> slot of the cons cell holds the element, and its <span class="sc">cdr</span>
slot refers to the next cons cell of the list, which holds the next
element in the list.  The <span class="sc">cdr</span> slot of the last cons cell is set to
hold <code>nil</code>.

   <p>The names <span class="sc">car</span> and <span class="sc">cdr</span> derive from the history of Lisp.  The
original Lisp implementation ran on an IBM&nbsp;704<!-- /@w --> computer which
divided words into two parts, called the &ldquo;address&rdquo; part and the
&ldquo;decrement&rdquo;; <span class="sc">car</span> was an instruction to extract the contents of
the address part of a register, and <span class="sc">cdr</span> an instruction to extract
the contents of the decrement.  By contrast, &ldquo;cons cells&rdquo; are named
for the function <code>cons</code> that creates them, which in turn was named
for its purpose, the construction of cells.
