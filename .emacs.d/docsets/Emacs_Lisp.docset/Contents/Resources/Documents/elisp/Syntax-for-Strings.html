<p>The read syntax for a string is a double-quote, an arbitrary number
of characters, and another double-quote, <code>&quot;like this&quot;</code>.  To
include a double-quote in a string, precede it with a backslash; thus,
<code>&quot;\&quot;&quot;</code> is a string containing just one double-quote
character.  Likewise, you can include a backslash by preceding it with
another backslash, like this: <code>&quot;this \\ is a single embedded
backslash&quot;</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-newline-in-strings"></a>
<p>The newline character is not special in the read syntax for strings;
if you write a new line between the double-quotes, it becomes a
character in the string.  But an escaped newline&mdash;one that is preceded
by &lsquo;<samp>\</samp>&rsquo;&mdash;does not become part of the string; i.e., the Lisp reader
ignores an escaped newline while reading a string.  An escaped space
&lsquo;<samp>\&nbsp;</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> is likewise ignored.
</p>

<pre class="example">&quot;It is useful to include newlines
in documentation strings,

ignored if escaped.&quot;
