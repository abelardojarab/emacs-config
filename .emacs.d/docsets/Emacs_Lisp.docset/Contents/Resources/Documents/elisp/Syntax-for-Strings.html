<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.8.1 Syntax for Strings</h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0022_007d-in-strings-103"></a><a name="index-double_002dquote-in-strings-104"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005c_007d-in-strings-105"></a><a name="index-backslash-in-strings-106"></a>  The read syntax for a string is a double-quote, an arbitrary number
of characters, and another double-quote, <code>"like this"</code>.  To
include a double-quote in a string, precede it with a backslash; thus,
<code>"\""</code> is a string containing just a single double-quote
character.  Likewise, you can include a backslash by preceding it with
another backslash, like this: <code>"this \\ is a single embedded
backslash"</code>.

   <p><a name="index-newline-in-strings-107"></a>  The newline character is not special in the read syntax for strings;
if you write a new line between the double-quotes, it becomes a
character in the string.  But an escaped newline&mdash;one that is preceded
by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;&mdash;does not become part of the string; i.e., the Lisp reader
ignores an escaped newline while reading a string.  An escaped space
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> is likewise ignored.

<pre class="example">     "It is useful to include newlines
     in documentation strings,
     but the newline is \
     ignored if escaped."
          &rArr; "It is useful to include newlines
     in documentation strings,
     but the newline is ignored if escaped."
