<h3 class="section">D.7 Tips on Writing Comments</h3>

<p><a name="index-comments_002c-Lisp-convention-for-4393"></a>
  We recommend these conventions for comments:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Comments that start with a single semicolon, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;, should all be
aligned to the same column on the right of the source code.  Such
comments usually explain how the code on that line does its job. 
For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (setq base-version-list                 ; There was a base
                (assoc (substring fn 0 start-vn)  ; version to which
                       file-version-assoc-list))  ; this looks like
                                                  ; a subversion.
</pre>
     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Comments that start with two semicolons, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;</span></samp>&rsquo;, should be aligned to
the same level of indentation as the code.  Such comments usually
describe the purpose of the following lines or the state of the program
at that point.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (prog1 (setq auto-fill-function
                       ...
                       ...
            ;; Update mode line.
            (force-mode-line-update)))
</pre>
     <p>We also normally use two semicolons for comments outside functions.

     <pre class="smallexample">          ;; This Lisp code is run in Emacs when it is to operate as
          ;; a server for other processes.
</pre>
     <p>If a function has no documentation string, it should instead have a
two-semicolon comment right before the function, explaining what the
function does and how to call it properly.  Explain precisely what
each argument means and how the function interprets its possible
values.  It is much better to convert such comments to documentation
strings, though.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Comments that start with three semicolons, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;;</span></samp>&rsquo;, should start at
the left margin.  We use them
for comments which should be considered a
&ldquo;heading&rdquo; by Outline minor mode.  By default, comments starting with
at least three semicolons (followed by a single space and a
non-whitespace character) are considered headings, comments starting
with two or fewer are not.  Historically, triple-semicolon comments have
also been used for commenting out lines within a function, but this use
is discouraged.

     <p>When commenting out entire functions, use two semicolons.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;;;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Comments that start with four semicolons, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;;;</span></samp>&rsquo;, should be aligned
to the left margin and are used for headings of major sections of a
program.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          ;;;; The kill ring
</pre>
     </dl>

<p class="noindent">Generally speaking, the <kbd>M-;</kbd> (<code>comment-dwim</code>) command
automatically starts a comment of the appropriate type; or indents an
existing comment to the right place, depending on the number of
semicolons.
