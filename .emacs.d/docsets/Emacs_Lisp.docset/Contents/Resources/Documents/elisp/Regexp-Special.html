<h5 class="subsubsection">33.3.1.1 Special Characters in Regular Expressions</h5>

<p>Here is a list of the characters that are special in a regular
expression.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; <span class="roman">(Period)</span><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_002e_007d-in-regexp-3371"></a>is a special character that matches any single character except a newline. 
Using concatenation, we can make regular expressions like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a.b</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
matches any three-character string that begins with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; and ends with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_002a_007d-in-regexp-3372"></a>is not a construct by itself; it is a postfix operator that means to
match the preceding regular expression repetitively as many times as
possible.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o*</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any number of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;s (including no
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;s).

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; always applies to the <em>smallest</em> possible preceding
expression.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fo*</span></samp>&rsquo; has a repeating &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;, not a repeating
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fo</span></samp>&rsquo;.  It matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fo</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on.

     <p><a name="index-backtracking-and-regular-expressions-3373"></a>The matcher processes a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; construct by matching, immediately, as
many repetitions as can be found.  Then it continues with the rest of
the pattern.  If that fails, backtracking occurs, discarding some of the
matches of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;-modified construct in the hope that that will
make it possible to match the rest of the pattern.  For example, in
matching &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ca*ar</span></samp>&rsquo; against the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">caaar</span></samp>&rsquo;, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a*</span></samp>&rsquo;
first tries to match all three &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;s; but the rest of the pattern is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ar</span></samp>&rsquo; and there is only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; left to match, so this try fails. 
The next alternative is for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a*</span></samp>&rsquo; to match only two &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;s.  With
this choice, the rest of the regexp matches successfully.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Nested repetition operators can run for an
indefinitely long time, if they lead to ambiguous matching.  For
example, trying to match the regular expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(x+y*\)*a</span></samp>&rsquo;
against the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxz</span></samp>&rsquo; could
take hours before it ultimately fails.  Emacs must try each way of
grouping the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;s before concluding that none of them can work. 
Even worse, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(x*\)*</span></samp>&rsquo; can match the null string in infinitely
many ways, so it causes an infinite loop.  To avoid these problems,
check nested repetitions carefully, to make sure that they do not
cause combinatorial explosions in backtracking.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_002b_007d-in-regexp-3374"></a>is a postfix operator, similar to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; except that it must match
the preceding expression at least once.  So, for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ca+r</span></samp>&rsquo;
matches the strings &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">car</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">caaaar</span></samp>&rsquo; but not the string
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cr</span></samp>&rsquo;, whereas &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ca*r</span></samp>&rsquo; matches all three strings.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_003f_007d-in-regexp-3375"></a>is a postfix operator, similar to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; except that it must match the
preceding expression either once or not at all.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ca?r</span></samp>&rsquo; matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">car</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cr</span></samp>&rsquo;; nothing else.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*?</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+?</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">??</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-non_002dgreedy-repetition-characters-in-regexp-3376"></a>These are &ldquo;non-greedy&rdquo; variants of the operators &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Where those operators match the largest possible
substring (consistent with matching the entire containing expression),
the non-greedy variants match the smallest possible substring
(consistent with matching the entire containing expression).

     <p>For example, the regular expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c[ad]*a</span></samp>&rsquo; when applied to the
string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cdaaada</span></samp>&rsquo; matches the whole string; but the regular
expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c[ad]*?a</span></samp>&rsquo;, applied to that same string, matches just
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cda</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (The smallest possible match here for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[ad]*?</span></samp>&rsquo; that
permits the whole expression to match is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[ ... ]</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-character-alternative-_0028in-regexp_0029-3377"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005b_007d-in-regexp-3378"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005d_007d-in-regexp-3379"></a>is a <dfn>character alternative</dfn>, which begins with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; and is
terminated by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In the simplest case, the characters between
the two brackets are what this character alternative can match.

     <p>Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[ad]</span></samp>&rsquo; matches either one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; or one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[ad]*</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any string composed of just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;s and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;s
(including the empty string).  It follows that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c[ad]*r</span></samp>&rsquo;
matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cr</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">car</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cdr</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">caddaar</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc.

     <p>You can also include character ranges in a character alternative, by
writing the starting and ending characters with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; between them. 
Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a-z]</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any lower-case <acronym>ASCII</acronym> letter. 
Ranges may be intermixed freely with individual characters, as in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a-z$%.]</span></samp>&rsquo;, which matches any lower case <acronym>ASCII</acronym> letter
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; or period.

     <p>If <code>case-fold-search</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a-z]</span></samp>&rsquo; also
matches upper-case letters.  Note that a range like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a-z]</span></samp>&rsquo; is
not affected by the locale's collation sequence, it always represents
a sequence in <acronym>ASCII</acronym> order. 
<!-- This wasn't obvious to me, since, e.g., the grep manual "Character -->
<!-- Classes and Bracket Expressions" specifically notes the opposite -->
<!-- behavior.  But by experiment Emacs seems unaffected by LC_COLLATE -->
<!-- in this regard. -->

     <p>Note also that the usual regexp special characters are not special inside a
character alternative.  A completely different set of characters is
special inside character alternatives: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>To include a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; in a character alternative, you must make it the
first character.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]a]</span></samp>&rsquo; matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
To include a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; as the first or last character of
the character alternative, or put it after a range.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]-]</span></samp>&rsquo;
matches both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (As explained below, you cannot
use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\]</span></samp>&rsquo; to include a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; inside a character alternative,
since &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; is not special there.)

     <p>To include &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; in a character alternative, put it anywhere but at
the beginning.

     <!-- What if it starts with a multibyte and ends with a unibyte? -->
     <!-- That doesn't seem to match anything...? -->
     <p>If a range starts with a unibyte character <var>c</var> and ends with a
multibyte character <var>c2</var>, the range is divided into two parts: one
spans the unibyte characters &lsquo;<samp><var>c</var><span class="samp">..?\377</span></samp>&rsquo;, the other the
multibyte characters &lsquo;<samp><var>c1</var><span class="samp">..</span><var>c2</var></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>c1</var> is the
first character of the charset to which <var>c2</var> belongs.

     <p>A character alternative can also specify named character classes
(see <a href="Char-Classes.html#Char-Classes">Char Classes</a>).  This is a POSIX feature.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[[:ascii:]]</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any <acronym>ASCII</acronym> character. 
Using a character class is equivalent to mentioning each of the
characters in that class; but the latter is not feasible in practice,
since some classes include thousands of different characters.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[^ ... ]</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005e_007d-in-regexp-3380"></a>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[^</span></samp>&rsquo; begins a <dfn>complemented character alternative</dfn>.  This
matches any character except the ones specified.  Thus,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[^a-z0-9A-Z]</span></samp>&rsquo; matches all characters <em>except</em> letters and
digits.

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; is not special in a character alternative unless it is the first
character.  The character following the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; is treated as if it
were first (in other words, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; are not special there).

     <p>A complemented character alternative can match a newline, unless newline is
mentioned as one of the characters not to match.  This is in contrast to
the handling of regexps in programs such as <code>grep</code>.

     <p>You can specify named character classes, just like in character
alternatives.  For instance, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[^[:ascii:]]</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character.  See <a href="Char-Classes.html#Char-Classes">Char Classes</a>.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-beginning-of-line-in-regexp-3381"></a>When matching a buffer, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; matches the empty string, but only at the
beginning of a line in the text being matched (or the beginning of the
accessible portion of the buffer).  Otherwise it fails to match
anything.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^foo</span></samp>&rsquo; matches a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; that occurs at the
beginning of a line.

     <p>When matching a string instead of a buffer, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; matches at the
beginning of the string or after a newline character.

     <p>For historical compatibility reasons, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; can be used only at the
beginning of the regular expression, or after &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(?:</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0024_007d-in-regexp-3382"></a><a name="index-end-of-line-in-regexp-3383"></a>is similar to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; but matches only at the end of a line (or the
end of the accessible portion of the buffer).  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x+$</span></samp>&rsquo;
matches a string of one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; or more at the end of a line.

     <p>When matching a string instead of a buffer, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; matches at the end
of the string or before a newline character.

     <p>For historical compatibility reasons, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; can be used only at the
end of the regular expression, or before &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\)</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005c_007d-in-regexp-3384"></a>has two functions: it quotes the special characters (including
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;), and it introduces additional special constructs.

     <p>Because &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; quotes special characters, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\$</span></samp>&rsquo; is a regular
expression that matches only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\[</span></samp>&rsquo; is a regular
expression that matches only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on.

     <p>Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; also has special meaning in the read syntax of Lisp
strings (see <a href="String-Type.html#String-Type">String Type</a>), and must be quoted with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For
example, the regular expression that matches the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; character is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>&rsquo;.  To write a Lisp string that contains the characters
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>&rsquo;, Lisp syntax requires you to quote each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; with another
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Therefore, the read syntax for a regular expression matching
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; is <code>"\\\\"</code>. 
</dl>

   <p><strong>Please note:</strong> For historical compatibility, special characters
are treated as ordinary ones if they are in contexts where their special
meanings make no sense.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*foo</span></samp>&rsquo; treats &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; as
ordinary since there is no preceding expression on which the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;
can act.  It is poor practice to depend on this behavior; quote the
special character anyway, regardless of where it appears.

   <p>As a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; is not special inside a character alternative, it can
never remove the special meaning of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  So you
should not quote these characters when they have no special meaning
either.  This would not clarify anything, since backslashes can
legitimately precede these characters where they <em>have</em> special
meaning, as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[^\]</span></samp>&rsquo; (<code>"[^\\]"</code> for Lisp string syntax),
which matches any single character except a backslash.

   <p>In practice, most &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; that occur in regular expressions close a
character alternative and hence are special.  However, occasionally a
regular expression may try to match a complex pattern of literal
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In such situations, it sometimes may be
necessary to carefully parse the regexp from the start to determine
which square brackets enclose a character alternative.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[^][]]</span></samp>&rsquo; consists of the complemented character alternative
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[^][]</span></samp>&rsquo; (which matches any single character that is not a square
bracket), followed by a literal &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The exact rules are that at the beginning of a regexp, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; is
special and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; not.  This lasts until the first unquoted
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo;, after which we are in a character alternative; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; is
no longer special (except when it starts a character class) but &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;
is special, unless it immediately follows the special &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; or that
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This lasts until the next special
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; that does not end a character class.  This ends the character
alternative and restores the ordinary syntax of regular expressions;
an unquoted &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; is special again and a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; not.
