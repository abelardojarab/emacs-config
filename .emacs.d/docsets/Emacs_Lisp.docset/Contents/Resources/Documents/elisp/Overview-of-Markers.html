<h3 class="section">30.1 Overview of Markers</h3>

<p>A marker specifies a buffer and a position in that buffer.  A
marker can be used to represent a position in functions that
require one, just as an integer could be used.  In that case, the
marker&rsquo;s buffer is normally ignored.  Of course, a marker used in this
way usually points to a position in the buffer that the function
operates on, but that is entirely the programmer&rsquo;s responsibility.
See <a href="Positions.html#Positions">Positions</a>, for a complete description of positions.
</p>
<p>A marker has three attributes: the marker position, the marker
buffer, and the insertion type.  The marker position is an integer
that is equivalent (at a given time) to the marker as a position in
that buffer.  But the marker&rsquo;s position value can change during
the life of the marker, and often does.  Insertion and deletion of
text in the buffer relocate the marker.  The idea is that a marker
positioned between two characters remains between those two characters
despite insertion and deletion elsewhere in the buffer.  Relocation
changes the integer equivalent of the marker.
</p>
<a name="index-marker-relocation"></a>
<p>Deleting text around a marker&rsquo;s position leaves the marker between the
characters immediately before and after the deleted text.  Inserting
text at the position of a marker normally leaves the marker either in
front of or after the new text, depending on the marker&rsquo;s <em>insertion
type</em> (see <a href="Marker-Insertion-Types.html#Marker-Insertion-Types">Marker Insertion Types</a>)&mdash;unless the insertion is done
with <code>insert-before-markers</code> (see <a href="Insertion.html#Insertion">Insertion</a>).
</p>
<a name="index-marker-garbage-collection"></a>
<p>Insertion and deletion in a buffer must check all the markers and
relocate them if necessary.  This slows processing in a buffer with a
large number of markers.  For this reason, it is a good idea to make a
marker point nowhere if you are sure you don&rsquo;t need it any more.
Markers that can no longer be accessed are eventually removed
(see <a href="Garbage-Collection.html#Garbage-Collection">Garbage Collection</a>).
</p>
<a name="index-markers-as-numbers"></a>
<p>Because it is common to perform arithmetic operations on a marker
position, most of these operations (including <code>+</code> and
<code>-</code>) accept markers as arguments.  In such cases, the marker
stands for its current position.
</p>
<p>Here are examples of creating markers, setting markers, and moving point
to markers:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;; <span class="roman">Make a new marker that initially does not point anywhere:</span>
(setq m1 (make-marker))
     &rArr; #&lt;marker in no buffer&gt;
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">;; <span class="roman">Set <code>m1</code> to point between the 99th and 100th characters</span>
;;   <span class="roman">in the current buffer:</span>
(set-marker m1 100)
     &rArr; #&lt;marker at 100 in markers.texi&gt;
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">;; <span class="roman">Now insert one character at the beginning of the buffer:</span>
(goto-char (point-min))
     &rArr; 1
(insert &quot;Q&quot;)
     &rArr; nil
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">;; <span class="roman"><code>m1</code> is updated appropriately.</span>
m1
     &rArr; #&lt;marker at 101 in markers.texi&gt;
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">;; <span class="roman">Two markers that point to the same position</span>
;;   <span class="roman">are not <code>eq</code>, but they are <code>equal</code>.</span>
(setq m2 (copy-marker m1))
     &rArr; #&lt;marker at 101 in markers.texi&gt;
(eq m1 m2)
     &rArr; nil
(equal m1 m2)
     &rArr; t
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">;; <span class="roman">When you are finished using a marker, make it point nowhere.</span>
(set-marker m1 nil)
     &rArr; #&lt;marker in no buffer&gt;
</pre></div>
