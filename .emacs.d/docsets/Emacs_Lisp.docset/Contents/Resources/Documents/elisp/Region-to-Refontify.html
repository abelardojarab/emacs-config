<h5 class="subsubsection">22.6.9.2 Region to Fontify after a Buffer Change</h5>

<p>When a buffer is changed, the region that Font Lock refontifies is
by default the smallest sequence of whole lines that spans the change. 
While this works well most of the time, sometimes it doesn't—for
example, when a change alters the syntactic meaning of text on an
earlier line.

   </p><p>You can enlarge (or even reduce) the region to refontify by setting
the following variable:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/font%2Dlock%2Dextend%2Dafter%2Dchange%2Dregion%2Dfunction"></a><a name="DASH-1734"></a>— Variable: <b>font-lock-extend-after-change-region-function</b><var><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dextend_002dafter_002dchange_002dregion_002dfunction-1812"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This buffer-local variable is either <code>nil</code> or a function for Font
Lock mode to call to determine the region to scan and fontify.

        </p><p>The function is given three parameters, the standard <var>beg</var>,
<var>end</var>, and <var>old-len</var> from <code>after-change-functions</code>
(see <a href="Change-Hooks.html#Change-Hooks">Change Hooks</a>).  It should return either a cons of the
beginning and end buffer positions (in that order) of the region to
fontify, or <code>nil</code> (which means choose the region in the standard
way).  This function needs to preserve point, the match-data, and the
current restriction.  The region it returns may start or end in the
middle of a line.

        </p><p>Since this function is called after every buffer change, it should be
reasonably fast.
