<h4 class="subsection">31.8.4 Functions for Yanking</h4>

<p>This section describes higher-level commands for yanking, which are
intended primarily for the user but useful also in Lisp programs.
Both <code>yank</code> and <code>yank-pop</code> honor the
<code>yank-excluded-properties</code> variable and <code>yank-handler</code> text
property (see <a href="Yanking.html#Yanking">Yanking</a>).
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/yank"></a><a name="index-yank"></a>Command: <strong>yank</strong> <em>&amp;optional arg</em></dt>
<dd><a name="index-inserting-killed-text"></a>
<p>This command inserts before point the text at the front of the kill
ring.  It sets the mark at the beginning of that text, using
<code>push-mark</code> (see <a href="The-Mark.html#The-Mark">The Mark</a>), and puts point at the end.
</p>
<p>If <var>arg</var> is a non-<code>nil</code> list (which occurs interactively when
the user types <kbd>C-u</kbd> with no digits), then <code>yank</code> inserts the
text as described above, but puts point before the yanked text and
sets the mark after it.
</p>
<p>If <var>arg</var> is a number, then <code>yank</code> inserts the <var>arg</var>th
most recently killed textâ€”the <var>arg</var>th element of the kill ring
list, counted cyclically from the front, which is considered the
first element for this purpose.
</p>
<p><code>yank</code> does not alter the contents of the kill ring, unless it
used text provided by another program, in which case it pushes that text
onto the kill ring.  However if <var>arg</var> is an integer different from
one, it rotates the kill ring to place the yanked string at the front.
</p>
<p><code>yank</code> returns <code>nil</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/yank%2Dpop"></a><a name="index-yank_002dpop"></a>Command: <strong>yank-pop</strong> <em>&amp;optional arg</em></dt>
<dd><p>This command replaces the just-yanked entry from the kill ring with a
different entry from the kill ring.
</p>
<p>This is allowed only immediately after a <code>yank</code> or another
<code>yank-pop</code>.  At such a time, the region contains text that was just
inserted by yanking.  <code>yank-pop</code> deletes that text and inserts in
its place a different piece of killed text.  It does not add the deleted
text to the kill ring, since it is already in the kill ring somewhere.
It does however rotate the kill ring to place the newly yanked string at
the front.
</p>
<p>If <var>arg</var> is <code>nil</code>, then the replacement text is the previous
element of the kill ring.  If <var>arg</var> is numeric, the replacement is
the <var>arg</var>th previous kill.  If <var>arg</var> is negative, a more recent
kill is the replacement.
</p>
<p>The sequence of kills in the kill ring wraps around, so that after the
oldest one comes the newest one, and before the newest one goes the
oldest.
</p>
<p>The return value is always <code>nil</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/yank%2Dundo%2Dfunction"></a><a name="index-yank_002dundo_002dfunction"></a>Variable: <strong>yank-undo-function</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, the function <code>yank-pop</code> uses
its value instead of <code>delete-region</code> to delete the text
inserted by the previous <code>yank</code> or
<code>yank-pop</code> command.  The value must be a function of two
arguments, the start and end of the current region.
</p>
<p>The function <code>insert-for-yank</code> automatically sets this variable
according to the <var>undo</var> element of the <code>yank-handler</code>
text property, if there is one.
