  A <dfn>comment</dfn> is text that is written in a program only for the sake
of humans that read the program, and that has no effect on the meaning
of the program.  In Lisp, a semicolon (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;) starts a comment if it
is not within a string or character constant.  The comment continues to
the end of line.  The Lisp reader discards comments; they do not become
part of the Lisp objects which represent the program within the Lisp
system.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#@</span><var>count</var></samp>&rsquo; construct, which skips the next <var>count</var>
characters, is useful for program-generated comments containing binary
data.  The Emacs Lisp byte compiler uses this in its output files
(see <a href="Byte-Compilation.html#Byte-Compilation">Byte Compilation</a>).  It isn't meant for source files, however.

   <p>See <a href="Comment-Tips.html#Comment-Tips">Comment Tips</a>, for conventions for formatting comments.
