  A <dfn>self-evaluating form</dfn> is any form that is not a list or
symbol.  Self-evaluating forms evaluate to themselves: the result of
evaluation is the same object that was evaluated.  Thus, the number 25
evaluates to 25, and the string <code>"foo"</code> evaluates to the string
<code>"foo"</code>.  Likewise, evaluating a vector does not cause evaluation
of the elements of the vector&mdash;it returns the same vector with its
contents unchanged.

<pre class="example">     '123               ; <span class="roman">A number, shown without evaluation.</span>
          &rArr; 123
     123                ; <span class="roman">Evaluated as usual---result is the same.</span>
          &rArr; 123
     (eval '123)        ; <span class="roman">Evaluated ``by hand''---result is the same.</span>
          &rArr; 123
     (eval (eval '123)) ; <span class="roman">Evaluating twice changes nothing.</span>
          &rArr; 123
</pre>
   <p>It is common to write numbers, characters, strings, and even vectors
in Lisp code, taking advantage of the fact that they self-evaluate. 
However, it is quite unusual to do this for types that lack a read
syntax, because there's no way to write them textually.  It is possible
to construct Lisp expressions containing these types by means of a Lisp
program.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     ;; <span class="roman">Build an expression containing a buffer object.</span>
     (setq print-exp (list 'print (current-buffer)))
          &rArr; (print #&lt;buffer eval.texi&gt;)
     ;; <span class="roman">Evaluate it.</span>
     (eval print-exp)
          -| #&lt;buffer eval.texi&gt;
          &rArr; #&lt;buffer eval.texi&gt;
</pre>
   </body></html>
