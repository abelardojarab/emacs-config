<h5 class="subsubsection">10.5.3.3 Writing Code to Handle Errors</h5>

<p><a name="index-error-handler-593"></a><a name="index-handling-errors-594"></a>
  The usual effect of signaling an error is to terminate the command
that is running and return immediately to the Emacs editor command loop. 
You can arrange to trap errors occurring in a part of your program by
establishing an error handler, with the special form
<code>condition-case</code>.  A simple example looks like this:

</p><pre class="example">     (condition-case nil
         (delete-file filename)
       (error nil))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This deletes the file named <var>filename</var>, catching any error and
returning <code>nil</code> if an error occurs.  (You can use the macro
<code>ignore-errors</code> for a simple case like this; see below.)

   </p><p>The <code>condition-case</code> construct is often used to trap errors that
are predictable, such as failure to open a file in a call to
<code>insert-file-contents</code>.  It is also used to trap errors that are
totally unpredictable, such as when the program evaluates an expression
read from the user.

   </p><p>The second argument of <code>condition-case</code> is called the
<dfn>protected form</dfn>.  (In the example above, the protected form is a
call to <code>delete-file</code>.)  The error handlers go into effect when
this form begins execution and are deactivated when this form returns. 
They remain in effect for all the intervening time.  In particular, they
are in effect during the execution of functions called by this form, in
their subroutines, and so on.  This is a good thing, since, strictly
speaking, errors can be signaled only by Lisp primitives (including
<code>signal</code> and <code>error</code>) called by the protected form, not by the
protected form itself.

   </p><p>The arguments after the protected form are handlers.  Each handler
lists one or more <dfn>condition names</dfn> (which are symbols) to specify
which errors it will handle.  The error symbol specified when an error
is signaled also defines a list of condition names.  A handler applies
to an error if they have any condition names in common.  In the example
above, there is one handler, and it specifies one condition name,
<code>error</code>, which covers all errors.

   </p><p>The search for an applicable handler checks all the established handlers
starting with the most recently established one.  Thus, if two nested
<code>condition-case</code> forms offer to handle the same error, the inner of
the two gets to handle it.

   </p><p>If an error is handled by some <code>condition-case</code> form, this
ordinarily prevents the debugger from being run, even if
<code>debug-on-error</code> says this error should invoke the debugger.

   </p><p>If you want to be able to debug errors that are caught by a
<code>condition-case</code>, set the variable <code>debug-on-signal</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value.  You can also specify that a particular handler
should let the debugger run first, by writing <code>debug</code> among the
conditions, like this:

</p><pre class="example">     (condition-case nil
         (delete-file filename)
       ((debug error) nil))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The effect of <code>debug</code> here is only to prevent
<code>condition-case</code> from suppressing the call to the debugger.  Any
given error will invoke the debugger only if <code>debug-on-error</code> and
the other usual filtering mechanisms say it should.  See <a href="Error-Debugging.html#Error-Debugging">Error Debugging</a>.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/macro/condition%2Dcase%2Dunless%2Ddebug"></a><a name="DASH-1008"></a>— Macro: <b>condition-case-unless-debug</b><var> var protected-form handlers<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-condition_002dcase_002dunless_002ddebug-595"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The macro <code>condition-case-unless-debug</code> provides another way to
handle debugging of such forms.  It behaves exactly like
<code>condition-case</code>, unless the variable <code>debug-on-error</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, in which case it does not handle any errors at all. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Once Emacs decides that a certain handler handles the error, it
returns control to that handler.  To do so, Emacs unbinds all variable
bindings made by binding constructs that are being exited, and
executes the cleanups of all <code>unwind-protect</code> forms that are
being exited.  Once control arrives at the handler, the body of the
handler executes normally.

   </p><p>After execution of the handler body, execution returns from the
<code>condition-case</code> form.  Because the protected form is exited
completely before execution of the handler, the handler cannot resume
execution at the point of the error, nor can it examine variable
bindings that were made within the protected form.  All it can do is
clean up and proceed.

   </p><p>Error signaling and handling have some resemblance to <code>throw</code> and
<code>catch</code> (see <a href="Catch-and-Throw.html#Catch-and-Throw">Catch and Throw</a>), but they are entirely separate
facilities.  An error cannot be caught by a <code>catch</code>, and a
<code>throw</code> cannot be handled by an error handler (though using
<code>throw</code> when there is no suitable <code>catch</code> signals an error
that can be handled).

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/condition%2Dcase"></a><a name="DASH-1009"></a>— Special Form: <b>condition-case</b><var> var protected-form handlers<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-condition_002dcase-596"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form establishes the error handlers <var>handlers</var> around
the execution of <var>protected-form</var>.  If <var>protected-form</var> executes
without error, the value it returns becomes the value of the
<code>condition-case</code> form; in this case, the <code>condition-case</code> has
no effect.  The <code>condition-case</code> form makes a difference when an
error occurs during <var>protected-form</var>.

        </p><p>Each of the <var>handlers</var> is a list of the form <code>(</code><var>conditions</var>
<var>body</var><code>...)</code>.  Here <var>conditions</var> is an error condition name
to be handled, or a list of condition names (which can include <code>debug</code>
to allow the debugger to run before the handler); <var>body</var> is one or more
Lisp expressions to be executed when this handler handles an error. 
Here are examples of handlers:

     </p><pre class="example">          (error nil)
          
          (arith-error (message "Division by zero"))
          
          ((arith-error file-error)
           (message
            "Either division by zero or failure to open a file"))
</pre>
        <p>Each error that occurs has an <dfn>error symbol</dfn> that describes what
kind of error it is, and which describes also a list of condition names
(see <a href="Error-Symbols.html#Error-Symbols">Error Symbols</a>).  Emacs
searches all the active <code>condition-case</code> forms for a handler that
specifies one or more of these condition names; the innermost matching
<code>condition-case</code> handles the error.  Within this
<code>condition-case</code>, the first applicable handler handles the error.

        </p><p>After executing the body of the handler, the <code>condition-case</code>
returns normally, using the value of the last form in the handler body
as the overall value.

        </p><p><a name="index-error-description-597"></a>The argument <var>var</var> is a variable.  <code>condition-case</code> does not
bind this variable when executing the <var>protected-form</var>, only when it
handles an error.  At that time, it binds <var>var</var> locally to an
<dfn>error description</dfn>, which is a list giving the particulars of the
error.  The error description has the form <code>(</code><var>error-symbol</var><code>
. </code><var>data</var><code>)</code>.  The handler can refer to this list to decide what to
do.  For example, if the error is for failure opening a file, the file
name is the second element of <var>data</var>—the third element of the
error description.

        </p><p>If <var>var</var> is <code>nil</code>, that means no variable is bound.  Then the
error symbol and associated data are not available to the handler.

        </p><p><a name="index-rethrow-a-signal-598"></a>Sometimes it is necessary to re-throw a signal caught by
<code>condition-case</code>, for some outer-level handler to catch.  Here's
how to do that:

     </p><pre class="example">            (signal (car err) (cdr err))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">where <code>err</code> is the error description variable, the first argument
to <code>condition-case</code> whose error condition you want to re-throw. 
See <a href="Definition-of-signal.html#Definition-of-signal">Definition of signal</a>.

</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007barith_002derror_007d-example-600"></a>Here is an example of using <code>condition-case</code> to handle the error
that results from dividing by zero.  The handler displays the error
message (but without a beep), then returns a very large number.

</p><pre class="example">     (defun safe-divide (dividend divisor)
       (condition-case err
           ;; <span class="roman">Protected form.</span>
           (/ dividend divisor)
         ;; <span class="roman">The handler.</span>
         (arith-error                        ; <span class="roman">Condition.</span>
          ;; <span class="roman">Display the usual message for this error.</span>
          (message "%s" (error-message-string err))
          1000000)))
     ⇒ safe-divide
     
     (safe-divide 5 0)
          -| Arithmetic error: (arith-error)
     ⇒ 1000000
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The handler specifies condition name <code>arith-error</code> so that it
will handle only division-by-zero errors.  Other kinds of errors will
not be handled (by this <code>condition-case</code>).  Thus:

</p><pre class="example">     (safe-divide nil 3)
          error--&gt; Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p, nil
</pre>
   <p>Here is a <code>condition-case</code> that catches all kinds of errors,
including those from <code>error</code>:

</p><pre class="example">     (setq baz 34)
          ⇒ 34
     
     (condition-case err
         (if (eq baz 35)
             t
           ;; <span class="roman">This is a call to the function </span><code>error</code><span class="roman">.</span>
           (error "Rats!  The variable %s was %s, not 35" 'baz baz))
       ;; <span class="roman">This is the handler; it is not a form.</span>
       (error (princ (format "The error was: %s" err))
              2))
     -| The error was: (error "Rats!  The variable baz was 34, not 35")
     ⇒ 2

It uses the string <var>format</var> to format the message. 
<var>format</var> should contain a single ‘<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>’-sequence; e.g.,
<code>"Error: %S"</code>.  Use <code>with-demoted-errors</code> around code
that is not expected to signal errors, but
should be robust if one does occur.  Note that this macro uses
<code>condition-case-unless-debug</code> rather than <code>condition-case</code>.
