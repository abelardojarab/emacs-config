<h4 class="subsection">20.7.5 Drag Events</h4>

<p><a name="index-drag-event-1357"></a><a name="index-mouse-drag-event-1358"></a>
With Emacs, you can have a drag event without even changing your
clothes.  A <dfn>drag event</dfn> happens every time the user presses a mouse
button and then moves the mouse to a different character position before
releasing the button.  Like all mouse events, drag events are
represented in Lisp as lists.  The lists record both the starting mouse
position and the final position, like this:

<pre class="example">     (<var>event-type</var>
      (<var>window1</var> START-POSITION)
      (<var>window2</var> END-POSITION))
</pre>
   <p>For a drag event, the name of the symbol <var>event-type</var> contains the
prefix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drag-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For example, dragging the mouse with button 2
held down generates a <code>drag-mouse-2</code> event.  The second and third
elements of the event give the starting and ending position of the
drag, as mouse position lists (see <a href="Click-Events.html#Click-Events">Click Events</a>).  You can access
the second element of any mouse event in the same way, with no need to
distinguish drag events from others.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drag-</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix follows the modifier key prefixes such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If <code>read-key-sequence</code> receives a drag event that has no key
binding, and the corresponding click event does have a binding, it
changes the drag event into a click event at the drag's starting
position.  This means that you don't have to distinguish between click
and drag events unless you want to.
