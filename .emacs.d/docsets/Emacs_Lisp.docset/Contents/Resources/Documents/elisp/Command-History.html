<p>The command loop keeps a history of the complex commands that have
been executed, to make it convenient to repeat these commands.  A
<em>complex command</em> is one for which the interactive argument reading
uses the minibuffer.  This includes any <kbd>M-x</kbd> command, any
<kbd>M-:</kbd> command, and any command whose <code>interactive</code>
specification reads an argument from the minibuffer.  Explicit use of
the minibuffer during the execution of the command itself does not cause
the command to be considered complex.

<dd><p>This variable’s value is a list of recent complex commands, each
represented as a form to evaluate.  It continues to accumulate all
complex commands for the duration of the editing session, but when it
reaches the maximum size (see <a href="Minibuffer-History.html#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>), the oldest
elements are deleted as new ones are added.

<p>This history list is actually a special case of minibuffer history
(see <a href="Minibuffer-History.html#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>), with one special twist: the elements are
expressions rather than strings.
</p>
<p>There are a number of commands devoted to the editing and recall of
previous commands.  The commands <code>repeat-complex-command</code>, and
<code>list-command-history</code> are described in the user manual
(see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Repetition.html#Repetition">Repetition</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>).  Within the
minibuffer, the usual minibuffer history commands are available.
