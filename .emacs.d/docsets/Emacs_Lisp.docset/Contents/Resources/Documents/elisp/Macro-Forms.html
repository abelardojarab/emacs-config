<h4 class="subsection">9.2.6 Lisp Macro Evaluation</h4>
<a name="index-macro-call-evaluation"></a>

<p>If the first element of a list being evaluated is a macro object, then
the list is a <em>macro call</em>.  When a macro call is evaluated, the
elements of the rest of the list are <em>not</em> initially evaluated.
Instead, these elements themselves are used as the arguments of the
macro.  The macro definition computes a replacement form, called the
<em>expansion</em> of the macro, to be evaluated in place of the original
form.  The expansion may be any sort of form: a self-evaluating
constant, a symbol, or a list.  If the expansion is itself a macro call,
this process of expansion repeats until some other sort of form results.
</p>
<p>Ordinary evaluation of a macro call finishes by evaluating the
expansion.  However, the macro expansion is not necessarily evaluated
right away, or at all, because other programs also expand macro calls,
and they may or may not evaluate the expansions.
</p>
<p>Normally, the argument expressions are not evaluated as part of
computing the macro expansion, but instead appear as part of the
expansion, so they are computed when the expansion is evaluated.
</p>
<p>For example, given a macro defined as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defmacro cadr (x)
  (list 'car (list 'cdr x)))
</pre></div>

<p>an expression such as <code>(cadr (assq 'handler list))</code> is a macro
call, and its expansion is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(car (cdr (assq 'handler list)))
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the argument <code>(assq 'handler list)</code> appears in the
expansion.
