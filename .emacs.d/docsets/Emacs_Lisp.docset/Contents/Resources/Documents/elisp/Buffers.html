<h2 class="chapter">26 Buffers</h2>

<p><a name="index-buffer-2138"></a>
  A <dfn>buffer</dfn> is a Lisp object containing text to be edited.  Buffers
are used to hold the contents of files that are being visited; there may
also be buffers that are not visiting files.  While several buffers may
exist at one time, only one buffer is designated the <dfn>current
buffer</dfn> at any time.  Most editing commands act on the contents of the
current buffer.  Each buffer, including the current buffer, may or may
not be displayed in any windows.
