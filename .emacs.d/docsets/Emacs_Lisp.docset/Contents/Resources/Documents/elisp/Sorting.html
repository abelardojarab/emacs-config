<p>The sorting functions described in this section all rearrange text in
a buffer.  This is in contrast to the function <code>sort</code>, which
rearranges the order of the elements of a list (see <a href="Rearrangement.html#Rearrangement">Rearrangement</a>).
The values returned by these functions are not meaningful.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/sort%2Dsubr"></a><a name="index-sort_002dsubr"></a>Function: <strong>sort-subr</strong> <em>reverse nextrecfun endrecfun &amp;optional startkeyfun endkeyfun predicate</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function is the general text-sorting routine that subdivides a
buffer into records and then sorts them.  Most of the commands in this
section use this function.
</p>
<p>To understand how <code>sort-subr</code> works, consider the whole accessible
portion of the buffer as being divided into disjoint pieces called
<em>sort records</em>.  The records may or may not be contiguous, but they
must not overlap.  A portion of each sort record (perhaps all of it) is
designated as the sort key.  Sorting rearranges the records in order by
their sort keys.
</p>
<p>Usually, the records are rearranged in order of ascending sort key.
If the first argument to the <code>sort-subr</code> function, <var>reverse</var>,
is non-<code>nil</code>, the sort records are rearranged in order of
descending sort key.
</p>
<p>The next four arguments to <code>sort-subr</code> are functions that are
called to move point across a sort record.  They are called many times
from within <code>sort-subr</code>.
</p>
<ol>
<li> <var>nextrecfun</var> is called with point at the end of a record.  This
function moves point to the start of the next record.  The first record
is assumed to start at the position of point when <code>sort-subr</code> is
called.  Therefore, you should usually move point to the beginning of
the buffer before calling <code>sort-subr</code>.

<p>This function can indicate there are no more sort records by leaving
point at the end of the buffer.
</p>
</li><li> <var>endrecfun</var> is called with point within a record.  It moves point to
the end of the record.

</li><li> <var>startkeyfun</var> is called to move point from the start of a record to
the start of the sort key.  This argument is optional; if it is omitted,
the whole record is the sort key.  If supplied, the function should
either return a non-<code>nil</code> value to be used as the sort key, or
return <code>nil</code> to indicate that the sort key is in the buffer
starting at point.  In the latter case, <var>endkeyfun</var> is called to
find the end of the sort key.

</li><li> <var>endkeyfun</var> is called to move point from the start of the sort key
to the end of the sort key.  This argument is optional.  If
<var>startkeyfun</var> returns <code>nil</code> and this argument is omitted (or
<code>nil</code>), then the sort key extends to the end of the record.  There
is no need for <var>endkeyfun</var> if <var>startkeyfun</var> returns a
non-<code>nil</code> value.
</li></ol>

<p>The argument <var>predicate</var> is the function to use to compare keys.
If keys are numbers, it defaults to <code>&lt;</code>; otherwise it defaults to
<code>string&lt;</code>.
</p>
<p>As an example of <code>sort-subr</code>, here is the complete function
definition for <code>sort-lines</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;; <span class="roman">Note that the first two lines of doc string</span>
;; <span class="roman">are effectively one line when viewed by a user.</span>
(defun sort-lines (reverse beg end)
  "Sort lines in region alphabetically;\
 argument means descending order.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
</pre><pre class="example">REVERSE (non-nil means reverse order),\
 BEG and END (region to sort).
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines\
 whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order."
</pre><pre class="example">  (interactive "P\nr")
  (save-excursion
    (save-restriction
      (narrow-to-region beg end)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (let ((inhibit-field-text-motion t))
        (sort-subr reverse 'forward-line 'end-of-line)))))
</pre></div>

<p>Here <code>forward-line</code> moves point to the start of the next record,
and <code>end-of-line</code> moves point to the end of record.  We do not pass
the arguments <var>startkeyfun</var> and <var>endkeyfun</var>, because the entire
record is used as the sort key.
</p>
<p>The <code>sort-paragraphs</code> function is very much the same, except that
its <code>sort-subr</code> call looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(sort-subr reverse
           (function
            (lambda ()
              (while (and (not (eobp))
                          (looking-at paragraph-separate))
                (forward-line 1))))
           'forward-paragraph)
</pre></div>

<p>Markers pointing into any sort records are left with no useful
position after <code>sort-subr</code> returns.
</p></dd></dl>

<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/sort%2Dfold%2Dcase"></a><a name="index-sort_002dfold_002dcase"></a>User Option: <strong>sort-fold-case</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>sort-subr</code> and the other
buffer sorting functions ignore case when comparing strings.
</p></dd></dl>

<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/sort%2Dregexp%2Dfields"></a><a name="index-sort_002dregexp_002dfields"></a>Command: <strong>sort-regexp-fields</strong> <em>reverse record-regexp key-regexp start end</em></dt>
<dd><p>This command sorts the region between <var>start</var> and <var>end</var>
alphabetically as specified by <var>record-regexp</var> and <var>key-regexp</var>.
If <var>reverse</var> is a negative integer, then sorting is in reverse
order.
</p>
<p>Alphabetical sorting means that two sort keys are compared by
comparing the first characters of each, the second characters of each,
and so on.  If a mismatch is found, it means that the sort keys are
unequal; the sort key whose character is less at the point of first
mismatch is the lesser sort key.  The individual characters are compared
according to their numerical character codes in the Emacs character set.
</p>
<p>The value of the <var>record-regexp</var> argument specifies how to divide
the buffer into sort records.  At the end of each record, a search is
done for this regular expression, and the text that matches it is taken
as the next record.  For example, the regular expression ‘<samp>^.+$</samp>’,
which matches lines with at least one character besides a newline, would
make each such line into a sort record.  See <a href="Regular-Expressions.html#Regular-Expressions">Regular Expressions</a>, for
a description of the syntax and meaning of regular expressions.
</p>
<p>The value of the <var>key-regexp</var> argument specifies what part of each
record is the sort key.  The <var>key-regexp</var> could match the whole
record, or only a part.  In the latter case, the rest of the record has
no effect on the sorted order of records, but it is carried along when
the record moves to its new position.
</p>
<p>The <var>key-regexp</var> argument can refer to the text matched by a
subexpression of <var>record-regexp</var>, or it can be a regular expression
on its own.
</p>
<p>If <var>key-regexp</var> is:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>\<var>digit</var></samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>then the text matched by the <var>digit</var>th ‘<samp>\(...\)</samp>’ parenthesis
grouping in <var>record-regexp</var> is the sort key.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>\&amp;</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>then the whole record is the sort key.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>a regular expression</dt>
<dd><p>then <code>sort-regexp-fields</code> searches for a match for the regular
expression within the record.  If such a match is found, it is the sort
key.  If there is no match for <var>key-regexp</var> within a record then
that record is ignored, which means its position in the buffer is not
changed.  (The other records may move around it.)
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>For example, if you plan to sort all the lines in the region by the
first word on each line starting with the letter ‘<samp>f</samp>’, you should
set <var>record-regexp</var> to ‘<samp>^.*$</samp>’ and set <var>key-regexp</var> to
‘<samp>\&lt;f\w*\&gt;</samp>’.  The resulting expression looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(sort-regexp-fields nil "^.*$" "\\&lt;f\\w*\\&gt;"
                    (region-beginning)
                    (region-end))
</pre></div>

<p>If you call <code>sort-regexp-fields</code> interactively, it prompts for
<var>record-regexp</var> and <var>key-regexp</var> in the minibuffer.

<dd><p>This command sorts lines in the region between <var>start</var> and
<var>end</var>, comparing them numerically by the <var>field</var>th field of
each line.  Fields are separated by whitespace and numbered starting
from 1.  The specified field must contain a number in each line of the
region.  Numbers starting with 0 are treated as octal, and numbers
starting with ‘<samp>0x</samp>’ are treated as hexadecimal.
</p>
<p>If <var>field</var> is negative, sorting is by the
-<var>field</var>th<!-- /@w --> field from the end of the line.  This
command is useful for sorting tables.

<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/sort%2Dcolumns"></a><a name="index-sort_002dcolumns"></a>Command: <strong>sort-columns</strong> <em>reverse &amp;optional beg end</em></dt>
<dd><p>This command sorts the lines in the region between <var>beg</var> and
<var>end</var>, comparing them alphabetically by a certain range of
columns.  The column positions of <var>beg</var> and <var>end</var> bound the
range of columns to sort on.
</p>
<p>If <var>reverse</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the sort is in reverse order.
</p>
<p>One unusual thing about this command is that the entire line
containing position <var>beg</var>, and the entire line containing position
<var>end</var>, are included in the region sorted.
</p>
<p>Note that <code>sort-columns</code> rejects text that contains tabs, because
tabs could be split across the specified columns.  Use <kbd>M-x
untabify</kbd> to convert tabs to spaces before sorting.
</p>
<p>When possible, this command actually works by calling the <code>sort</code>
utility program.
