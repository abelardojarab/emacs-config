<h3 class="section">31.16 Counting Columns</h3>

<p><a name="index-columns-3011"></a><a name="index-counting-columns-3012"></a><a name="index-horizontal-position-3013"></a>
  The column functions convert between a character position (counting
characters from the beginning of the buffer) and a column position
(counting screen characters from the beginning of a line).

   </p><p>These functions count each character according to the number of
columns it occupies on the screen.  This means control characters count
as occupying 2 or 4 columns, depending upon the value of
<code>ctl-arrow</code>, and tabs count as occupying a number of columns that
depends on the value of <code>tab-width</code> and on the column where the tab
begins.  See <a href="Usual-Display.html#Usual-Display">Usual Display</a>.

   </p><p>Column number computations ignore the width of the window and the
amount of horizontal scrolling.  Consequently, a column value can be
arbitrarily high.  The first (or leftmost) column is numbered 0.  They
also ignore overlays and text properties, aside from invisibility.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/current%2Dcolumn"></a><a name="DASH-447"></a>— Function: <b>current-column</b><var><a name="index-current_002dcolumn-3014"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the horizontal position of point, measured in
columns, counting from 0 at the left margin.  The column position is the
sum of the widths of all the displayed representations of the characters
between the start of the current line and point.

        </p><p>For an example of using <code>current-column</code>, see the description of
<code>count-lines</code> in <a href="Text-Lines.html#Text-Lines">Text Lines</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/move%2Dto%2Dcolumn"></a><a name="DASH-448"></a>— Command: <b>move-to-column</b><var> column &amp;optional force<a name="index-move_002dto_002dcolumn-3015"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function moves point to <var>column</var> in the current line.  The
calculation of <var>column</var> takes into account the widths of the
displayed representations of the characters between the start of the
line and point.

        </p><p>When called interactively, <var>column</var> is the value of prefix numeric
argument.  If <var>column</var> is not an integer, an error is signaled.

     <!-- This behavior used to be documented until 2013/08. -->
        </p><p>If it is impossible to move to column <var>column</var> because that is in
the middle of a multicolumn character such as a tab, point moves to the
end of that character.  However, if <var>force</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, and
<var>column</var> is in the middle of a tab, then <code>move-to-column</code>
converts the tab into spaces so that it can move precisely to column
<var>column</var>.  Other multicolumn characters can cause anomalies despite
<var>force</var>, since there is no way to split them.

        </p><p>The argument <var>force</var> also has an effect if the line isn't long
enough to reach column <var>column</var>; if it is <code>t</code>, that means to
add whitespace at the end of the line to reach that column.

        </p><p>The return value is the column number actually moved to.
