<h3 class="section">16.3 Documentation Strings and Compilation</h3>

<p><a name="index-dynamic-loading-of-documentation-943"></a>
  When Emacs loads functions and variables from a byte-compiled file,
it normally does not load their documentation strings into memory. 
Each documentation string is “dynamically” loaded from the
byte-compiled file only when needed.  This saves memory, and speeds up
loading by skipping the processing of the documentation strings.

   </p><p>This feature has a drawback: if you delete, move, or alter the
compiled file (such as by compiling a new version), Emacs may no
longer be able to access the documentation string of previously-loaded
functions or variables.  Such a problem normally only occurs if you
build Emacs yourself, and happen to edit and/or recompile the Lisp
source files.  To solve it, just reload each file after recompilation.

   </p><p>Dynamic loading of documentation strings from byte-compiled files is
determined, at compile time, for each byte-compiled file.  It can be
disabled via the option <code>byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings</code>.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/byte%2Dcompile%2Ddynamic%2Ddocstrings"></a><a name="DASH-767"></a>— User Option: <b>byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings</b><var><a name="index-byte_002dcompile_002ddynamic_002ddocstrings-944"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this is non-<code>nil</code>, the byte compiler generates compiled files
that are set up for dynamic loading of documentation strings.

        </p><p>To disable the dynamic loading feature for a specific file, set this
option to <code>nil</code> in its header line (see <a href="../emacs/File-Variables.html#File-Variables">Local Variables in Files</a>), like this:

     </p><pre class="smallexample">          -*-byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings: nil;-*-
</pre>
        <p>This is useful mainly if you expect to change the file, and you want
Emacs sessions that have already loaded it to keep working when the
file changes. 
</p></blockquote></div>

accomplished by writing compiled files with a special Lisp reader
construct, ‘<samp><span class="samp">#@</span><var>count</var></samp>’.  This construct skips the next
<var>count</var> characters.  It also uses the ‘<samp><span class="samp">#$</span></samp>’ construct, which
stands for “the name of this file, as a string”.  Do not use these
constructs in Lisp source files; they are not designed to be clear to
humans reading the file.
