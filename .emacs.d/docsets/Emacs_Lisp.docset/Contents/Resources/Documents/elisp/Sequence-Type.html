<h4 class="subsection">2.3.5 Sequence Types</h4>

<p>A <dfn>sequence</dfn> is a Lisp object that represents an ordered set of
elements.  There are two kinds of sequence in Emacs Lisp: <dfn>lists</dfn>
and <dfn>arrays</dfn>.

   <p>Lists are the most commonly-used sequences.  A list can hold
elements of any type, and its length can be easily changed by adding
or removing elements.  See the next subsection for more about lists.

   <p>Arrays are fixed-length sequences.  They are further subdivided into
strings, vectors, char-tables and bool-vectors.  Vectors can hold
elements of any type, whereas string elements must be characters, and
bool-vector elements must be <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code>.  Char-tables are
like vectors except that they are indexed by any valid character code. 
The characters in a string can have text properties like characters in
a buffer (see <a href="Text-Properties.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>), but vectors do not support text
properties, even when their elements happen to be characters.

   <p>Lists, strings and the other array types also share important
similarities.  For example, all have a length <var>l</var>, and all have
elements which can be indexed from zero to <var>l</var> minus one.  Several
functions, called sequence functions, accept any kind of sequence. 
For example, the function <code>length</code> reports the length of any kind
of sequence.  See <a href="Sequences-Arrays-Vectors.html#Sequences-Arrays-Vectors">Sequences Arrays Vectors</a>.

   <p>It is generally impossible to read the same sequence twice, since
sequences are always created anew upon reading.  If you read the read
syntax for a sequence twice, you get two sequences with equal contents. 
There is one exception: the empty list <code>()</code> always stands for the
same object, <code>nil</code>.
