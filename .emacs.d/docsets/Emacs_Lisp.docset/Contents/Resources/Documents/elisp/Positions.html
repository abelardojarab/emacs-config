<h2 class="chapter">29 Positions</h2>

<p><a name="index-position-_0028in-buffer_0029-2759"></a><a name="index-buffer-position-2760"></a>
  A <dfn>position</dfn> is the index of a character in the text of a buffer. 
More precisely, a position identifies the place between two characters
(or before the first character, or after the last character), so we can
speak of the character before or after a given position.  However, we
often speak of the character &ldquo;at&rdquo; a position, meaning the character
after that position.

   <p>Positions are usually represented as integers starting from 1, but
can also be represented as <dfn>markers</dfn>&mdash;special objects that
relocate automatically when text is inserted or deleted so they stay
with the surrounding characters.  Functions that expect an argument to
be a position (an integer), but accept a marker as a substitute,
normally ignore which buffer the marker points into; they convert the
marker to an integer, and use that integer, exactly as if you had
passed the integer as the argument, even if the marker points to the
&ldquo;wrong&rdquo; buffer.  A marker that points nowhere cannot convert to an
integer; using it instead of an integer causes an error. 
See <a href="Markers.html#Markers">Markers</a>.

   <p>See also the &ldquo;field&rdquo; feature (see <a href="Fields.html#Fields">Fields</a>), which provides
functions that are used by many cursor-motion commands.
