<h5 class="subsubsection">33.3.1.3 Backslash Constructs in Regular Expressions</h5>

<p><a name="index-backslash-in-regular-expressions-3386"></a>
  For the most part, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by any character matches only
that character.  However, there are several exceptions: certain
sequences starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; that have special meanings.  Here is
a table of the special &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; constructs.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_007c_007d-in-regexp-3387"></a><a name="index-regexp-alternative-3388"></a>specifies an alternative. 
Two regular expressions <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo; in
between form an expression that matches anything that either <var>a</var> or
<var>b</var> matches.

     <p>Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo\|bar</span></samp>&rsquo; matches either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>&rsquo;
but no other string.

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo; applies to the largest possible surrounding expressions.  Only a
surrounding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo; grouping can limit the grouping power of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>If you need full backtracking capability to handle multiple uses of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo;, use the POSIX regular expression functions (see <a href="POSIX-Regexps.html#POSIX-Regexps">POSIX Regexps</a>).

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\{</span><var>m</var><span class="samp">\}</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>is a postfix operator that repeats the previous pattern exactly <var>m</var>
times.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x\{5\}</span></samp>&rsquo; matches the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xxxxx</span></samp>&rsquo;
and nothing else.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c[ad]\{3\}r</span></samp>&rsquo; matches string such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">caaar</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cdddr</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cadar</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\{</span><var>m</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">\}</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>is a more general postfix operator that specifies repetition with a
minimum of <var>m</var> repeats and a maximum of <var>n</var> repeats.  If <var>m</var>
is omitted, the minimum is 0; if <var>n</var> is omitted, there is no
maximum.

     <p>For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c[ad]\{1,2\}r</span></samp>&rsquo; matches the strings &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">car</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cdr</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">caar</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cadr</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cdar</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cddr</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
nothing else.<br>
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\{0,1\}</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\{,1\}</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br>
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\{0,\}</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\{,\}</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;.<br>
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\{1,\}</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0028_007d-in-regexp-3389"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0029_007d-in-regexp-3390"></a><a name="index-regexp-grouping-3391"></a>is a grouping construct that serves three purposes:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>To enclose a set of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo; alternatives for other operations.  Thus,
the regular expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(foo\|bar\)x</span></samp>&rsquo; matches either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foox</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">barx</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <li>To enclose a complicated expression for the postfix operators &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; to operate on.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ba\(na\)*</span></samp>&rsquo; matches
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ba</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bana</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">banana</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bananana</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc., with any
number (zero or more) of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">na</span></samp>&rsquo; strings.

          <li>To record a matched substring for future reference with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>digit</var></samp>&rsquo; (see below).
          </ol>

     <p>This last application is not a consequence of the idea of a
parenthetical grouping; it is a separate feature that was assigned as a
second meaning to the same &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo; construct because, in
practice, there was usually no conflict between the two meanings.  But
occasionally there is a conflict, and that led to the introduction of
shy groups.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(?: ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-shy-groups-3392"></a><a name="index-non_002dcapturing-group-3393"></a><a name="index-unnumbered-group-3394"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0028_003f_003a_007d-in-regexp-3395"></a>is the <dfn>shy group</dfn> construct.  A shy group serves the first two
purposes of an ordinary group (controlling the nesting of other
operators), but it does not get a number, so you cannot refer back to
its value with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>digit</var></samp>&rsquo;.  Shy groups are particularly
useful for mechanically-constructed regular expressions, because they
can be added automatically without altering the numbering of ordinary,
non-shy groups.

     <p>Shy groups are also called <dfn>non-capturing</dfn> or <dfn>unnumbered
groups</dfn>.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(?</span><var>num</var><span class="samp">: ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>is the <dfn>explicitly numbered group</dfn> construct.  Normal groups get
their number implicitly, based on their position, which can be
inconvenient.  This construct allows you to force a particular group
number.  There is no particular restriction on the numbering,
e.g., you can have several groups with the same number in which case
the last one to match (i.e., the rightmost match) will win. 
Implicitly numbered groups always get the smallest integer larger than
the one of any previous group.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>digit</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>matches the same text that matched the <var>digit</var>th occurrence of a
grouping (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo;) construct.

     <p>In other words, after the end of a group, the matcher remembers the
beginning and end of the text matched by that group.  Later on in the
regular expression you can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by <var>digit</var> to
match that same text, whatever it may have been.

     <p>The strings matching the first nine grouping constructs appearing in
the entire regular expression passed to a search or matching function
are assigned numbers 1 through 9 in the order that the open
parentheses appear in the regular expression.  So you can use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\1</span></samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\9</span></samp>&rsquo; to refer to the text matched by the
corresponding grouping constructs.

     <p>For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(.*\)\1</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any newline-free string that is
composed of two identical halves.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(.*\)</span></samp>&rsquo; matches the first
half, which may be anything, but the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\1</span></samp>&rsquo; that follows must match
the same exact text.

     <p>If a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo; construct matches more than once (which can
happen, for instance, if it is followed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;), only the last
match is recorded.

     <p>If a particular grouping construct in the regular expression was never
matched&mdash;for instance, if it appears inside of an alternative that
wasn't used, or inside of a repetition that repeated zero times&mdash;then
the corresponding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>digit</var></samp>&rsquo; construct never matches
anything.  To use an artificial example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(foo\(b*\)\|lose\)\2</span></samp>&rsquo;
cannot match &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lose</span></samp>&rsquo;: the second alternative inside the larger
group matches it, but then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\2</span></samp>&rsquo; is undefined and can't match
anything.  But it can match &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foobb</span></samp>&rsquo;, because the first
alternative matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foob</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\2</span></samp>&rsquo; matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\w</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005cw_007d-in-regexp-3396"></a>matches any word-constituent character.  The editor syntax table
determines which characters these are.  See <a href="Syntax-Tables.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax Tables</a>.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\W</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005cW_007d-in-regexp-3397"></a>matches any character that is not a word constituent.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\s</span><var>code</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005cs_007d-in-regexp-3398"></a>matches any character whose syntax is <var>code</var>.  Here <var>code</var> is a
character that represents a syntax code: thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>&rsquo; for word
constituent, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; for whitespace, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo; for open parenthesis,
etc.  To represent whitespace syntax, use either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; or a space
character.  See <a href="Syntax-Class-Table.html#Syntax-Class-Table">Syntax Class Table</a>, for a list of syntax codes and
the characters that stand for them.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\S</span><var>code</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005cS_007d-in-regexp-3399"></a>matches any character whose syntax is not <var>code</var>.

     <p><a name="index-category_002c-regexp-search-for-3400"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\c</span><var>c</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>matches any character whose category is <var>c</var>.  Here <var>c</var> is a
character that represents a category: thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; for Chinese
characters or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>&rsquo; for Greek characters in the standard category
table.  You can see the list of all the currently defined categories
with <kbd>M-x describe-categories &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  You can also define
your own categories in addition to the standard ones using the
<code>define-category</code> function (see <a href="Categories.html#Categories">Categories</a>).

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\C</span><var>c</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>matches any character whose category is not <var>c</var>. 
</dl>

   <p>The following regular expression constructs match the empty string&mdash;that is,
they don't use up any characters&mdash;but whether they match depends on the
context.  For all, the beginning and end of the accessible portion of
the buffer are treated as if they were the actual beginning and end of
the buffer.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\`</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005c_0060_007d-in-regexp-3401"></a>matches the empty string, but only at the beginning
of the buffer or string being matched against.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\'</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005c_0027_007d-in-regexp-3402"></a>matches the empty string, but only at the end of
the buffer or string being matched against.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\=</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005c_003d_007d-in-regexp-3403"></a>matches the empty string, but only at point. 
(This construct is not defined when matching against a string.)

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\b</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005cb_007d-in-regexp-3404"></a>matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or
end of a word.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\bfoo\b</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any occurrence of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; as a separate word.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\bballs?\b</span></samp>&rsquo; matches
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ball</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">balls</span></samp>&rsquo; as a separate word.

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\b</span></samp>&rsquo; matches at the beginning or end of the buffer (or string)
regardless of what text appears next to it.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\B</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005cB_007d-in-regexp-3405"></a>matches the empty string, but <em>not</em> at the beginning or
end of a word, nor at the beginning or end of the buffer (or string).

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005c_003c_007d-in-regexp-3406"></a>matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of a word. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; matches at the beginning of the buffer (or string) only if a
word-constituent character follows.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005c_003e_007d-in-regexp-3407"></a>matches the empty string, but only at the end of a word.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
matches at the end of the buffer (or string) only if the contents end
with a word-constituent character.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\_&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005c_005f_003c_007d-in-regexp-3408"></a>matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of a symbol.  A
symbol is a sequence of one or more word or symbol constituent
characters.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\_&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; matches at the beginning of the buffer (or
string) only if a symbol-constituent character follows.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\_&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005c_005f_003e_007d-in-regexp-3409"></a>matches the empty string, but only at the end of a symbol.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\_&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
matches at the end of the buffer (or string) only if the contents end
with a symbol-constituent character. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-invalid_002dregexp-3410"></a>  Not every string is a valid regular expression.  For example, a string
that ends inside a character alternative without a terminating &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;
is invalid, and so is a string that ends with a single &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If
an invalid regular expression is passed to any of the search functions,
an <code>invalid-regexp</code> error is signaled.
