<h4 class="subsection">22.6.9 Multiline Font Lock Constructs</h4>

<p><a name="index-multiline-font-lock-1810"></a>
  Normally, elements of <code>font-lock-keywords</code> should not match
across multiple lines; that doesn't work reliably, because Font Lock
usually scans just part of the buffer, and it can miss a multi-line
construct that crosses the line boundary where the scan starts.  (The
scan normally starts at the beginning of a line.)

   <p>Making elements that match multiline constructs work properly has
two aspects: correct <em>identification</em> and correct
<em>rehighlighting</em>.  The first means that Font Lock finds all
multiline constructs.  The second means that Font Lock will correctly
rehighlight all the relevant text when a multiline construct is
changed&mdash;for example, if some of the text that was previously part of
a multiline construct ceases to be part of it.  The two aspects are
closely related, and often getting one of them to work will appear to
make the other also work.  However, for reliable results you must
attend explicitly to both aspects.

   <p>There are three ways to ensure correct identification of multiline
constructs:

     <ul>
<li>Add a function to <code>font-lock-extend-region-functions</code> that does
the <em>identification</em> and extends the scan so that the scanned
text never starts or ends in the middle of a multiline construct. 
<li>Use the <code>font-lock-fontify-region-function</code> hook similarly to
extend the scan so that the scanned text never starts or ends in the
middle of a multiline construct. 
<li>Somehow identify the multiline construct right when it gets inserted
into the buffer (or at any point after that but before font-lock
tries to highlight it), and mark it with a <code>font-lock-multiline</code>
which will instruct font-lock not to start or end the scan in the
middle of the construct. 
</ul>

   <p>There are three ways to do rehighlighting of multiline constructs:

     <ul>
<li>Place a <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property on the construct.  This
will rehighlight the whole construct if any part of it is changed.  In
some cases you can do this automatically by setting the
<code>font-lock-multiline</code> variable, which see. 
<li>Make sure <code>jit-lock-contextually</code> is set and rely on it doing its
job.  This will only rehighlight the part of the construct that
follows the actual change, and will do it after a short delay. 
This only works if the highlighting of the various parts of your
multiline construct never depends on text in subsequent lines. 
Since <code>jit-lock-contextually</code> is activated by default, this can
be an attractive solution. 
<li>Place a <code>jit-lock-defer-multiline</code> property on the construct. 
This works only if <code>jit-lock-contextually</code> is used, and with the
same delay before rehighlighting, but like <code>font-lock-multiline</code>,
it also handles the case where highlighting depends on
subsequent lines.
