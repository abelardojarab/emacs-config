<h3 class="section">12.14 Telling the Compiler that a Function is Defined</h3>

<p><a name="index-function-declaration-801"></a><a name="index-declaring-functions-802"></a><a name="index-declare_002dfunction-803"></a>
Byte-compiling a file often produces warnings about functions that the
compiler doesn't know about (see <a href="Compiler-Errors.html#Compiler-Errors">Compiler Errors</a>).  Sometimes this
indicates a real problem, but usually the functions in question are
defined in other files which would be loaded if that code is run.  For
example, byte-compiling <samp><span class="file">fortran.el</span></samp> used to warn:

</p><pre class="example">     In end of data:
     fortran.el:2152:1:Warning: the function `gud-find-c-expr' is not
         known to be defined.
</pre>
   <p>In fact, <code>gud-find-c-expr</code> is only used in the function that
Fortran mode uses for the local value of
<code>gud-find-expr-function</code>, which is a callback from GUD; if it is
called, the GUD functions will be loaded.  When you know that such a
warning does not indicate a real problem, it is good to suppress the
warning.  That makes new warnings which might mean real problems more
visible.  You do that with <code>declare-function</code>.

   </p><p>All you need to do is add a <code>declare-function</code> statement before the
first use of the function in question:

</p><pre class="example">     (declare-function gud-find-c-expr "gud.el" nil)
</pre>
   <p>This says that <code>gud-find-c-expr</code> is defined in <samp><span class="file">gud.el</span></samp> (the
‘<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>’ can be omitted).  The compiler takes for granted that that file
really defines the function, and does not check.

   </p><p>The optional third argument specifies the argument list of
<code>gud-find-c-expr</code>.  In this case, it takes no arguments
(<code>nil</code> is different from not specifying a value).  In other
cases, this might be something like <code>(file &amp;optional overwrite)</code>. 
You don't have to specify the argument list, but if you do the
byte compiler can check that the calls match the declaration.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/macro/declare%2Dfunction"></a><a name="DASH-639"></a>— Macro: <b>declare-function</b><var> function file &amp;optional arglist fileonly<a name="index-declare_002dfunction-804"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Tell the byte compiler to assume that <var>function</var> is defined, with
arguments <var>arglist</var>, and that the definition should come from the
file <var>file</var>.  <var>fileonly</var> non-<code>nil</code> means only check that
<var>file</var> exists, not that it actually defines <var>function</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>To verify that these functions really are declared where
<code>declare-function</code> says they are, use <code>check-declare-file</code>
to check all <code>declare-function</code> calls in one source file, or use
<code>check-declare-directory</code> check all the files in and under a
certain directory.

   </p><p>These commands find the file that ought to contain a function's
definition using <code>locate-library</code>; if that finds no file, they
expand the definition file name relative to the directory of the file
that contains the <code>declare-function</code> call.

   </p><p>You can also say that a function is a primitive by specifying a file
name ending in ‘<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>’ or ‘<samp><span class="samp">.m</span></samp>’.  This is useful only when you
call a primitive that is defined only on certain systems.  Most
primitives are always defined, so they will never give you a warning.

   </p><p>Sometimes a file will optionally use functions from an external package. 
If you prefix the filename in the <code>declare-function</code> statement with
‘<samp><span class="samp">ext:</span></samp>’, then it will be checked if it is found, otherwise skipped
without error.

   </p><p>There are some function definitions that ‘<samp><span class="samp">check-declare</span></samp>’ does not
understand (e.g., <code>defstruct</code> and some other macros).  In such cases,
you can pass a non-<code>nil</code> <var>fileonly</var> argument to
<code>declare-function</code>, meaning to only check that the file exists, not
that it actually defines the function.  Note that to do this without
having to specify an argument list, you should set the <var>arglist</var>
argument to <code>t</code> (because <code>nil</code> means an empty argument list, as
opposed to an unspecified one).
