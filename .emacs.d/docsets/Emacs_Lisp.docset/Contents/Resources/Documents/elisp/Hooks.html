<h3 class="section">22.1 Hooks</h3>

<p><a name="index-hooks-1668"></a>
  A <dfn>hook</dfn> is a variable where you can store a function or functions
to be called on a particular occasion by an existing program.  Emacs
provides hooks for the sake of customization.  Most often, hooks are set
up in the init file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>), but Lisp programs can set them also. 
See <a href="Standard-Hooks.html#Standard-Hooks">Standard Hooks</a>, for a list of some standard hook variables.

   <p><a name="index-normal-hook-1669"></a>  Most of the hooks in Emacs are <dfn>normal hooks</dfn>.  These variables
contain lists of functions to be called with no arguments.  By
convention, whenever the hook name ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>&rsquo;, that tells
you it is normal.  We try to make all hooks normal, as much as
possible, so that you can use them in a uniform way.

   <p>Every major mode command is supposed to run a normal hook called the
<dfn>mode hook</dfn> as one of the last steps of initialization.  This makes
it easy for a user to customize the behavior of the mode, by overriding
the buffer-local variable assignments already made by the mode.  Most
minor mode functions also run a mode hook at the end.  But hooks are
used in other contexts too.  For example, the hook <code>suspend-hook</code>
runs just before Emacs suspends itself (see <a href="Suspending-Emacs.html#Suspending-Emacs">Suspending Emacs</a>).

   <p>The recommended way to add a hook function to a hook is by calling
<code>add-hook</code> (see <a href="Setting-Hooks.html#Setting-Hooks">Setting Hooks</a>).  The hook functions may be any
of the valid kinds of functions that <code>funcall</code> accepts (see <a href="What-Is-a-Function.html#What-Is-a-Function">What Is a Function</a>).  Most normal hook variables are initially void;
<code>add-hook</code> knows how to deal with this.  You can add hooks either
globally or buffer-locally with <code>add-hook</code>.

   <p><a name="index-abnormal-hook-1670"></a>  If the hook variable's name does not end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>&rsquo;, that
indicates it is probably an <dfn>abnormal hook</dfn>.  That means the hook
functions are called with arguments, or their return values are used
in some way.  The hook's documentation says how the functions are
called.  You can use <code>add-hook</code> to add a function to an abnormal
hook, but you must write the function to follow the hook's calling
convention.  By convention, abnormal hook names end in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-functions</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-single_002dfunction-hook-1671"></a>If the variable's name ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-function</span></samp>&rsquo;, then its value is
just a single function, not a list of functions.  <code>add-hook</code> cannot be
used to modify such a <em>single function hook</em>, and you have to use
<code>add-function</code> instead (see <a href="Advising-Functions.html#Advising-Functions">Advising Functions</a>).
