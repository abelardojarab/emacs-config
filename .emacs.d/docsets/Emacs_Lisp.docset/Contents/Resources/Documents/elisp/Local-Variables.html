<h3 class="section">11.3 Local Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-binding-local-variables-626"></a><a name="index-local-variables-627"></a><a name="index-local-binding-628"></a><a name="index-global-binding-629"></a>
  Global variables have values that last until explicitly superseded
with new values.  Sometimes it is useful to give a variable a
<dfn>local value</dfn>—a value that takes effect only within a certain
part of a Lisp program.  When a variable has a local value, we say
that it is <dfn>locally bound</dfn> to that value, and that it is a
<dfn>local variable</dfn>.

   </p><p>For example, when a function is called, its argument variables
receive local values, which are the actual arguments supplied to the
function call; these local bindings take effect within the body of the
function.  To take another example, the <code>let</code> special form
explicitly establishes local bindings for specific variables, which
take effect within the body of the <code>let</code> form.

   </p><p>We also speak of the <dfn>global binding</dfn>, which is where
(conceptually) the global value is kept.

   </p><p><a name="index-shadowing-of-variables-630"></a>  Establishing a local binding saves away the variable's previous
value (or lack of one).  We say that the previous value is
<dfn>shadowed</dfn>.  Both global and local values may be shadowed.  If a
local binding is in effect, using <code>setq</code> on the local variable
stores the specified value in the local binding.  When that local
binding is no longer in effect, the previously shadowed value (or lack
of one) comes back.

   </p><p><a name="index-current-binding-631"></a>  A variable can have more than one local binding at a time (e.g., if
there are nested <code>let</code> forms that bind the variable).  The
<dfn>current binding</dfn> is the local binding that is actually in effect. 
It determines the value returned by evaluating the variable symbol,
and it is the binding acted on by <code>setq</code>.

   </p><p>For most purposes, you can think of the current binding as the
“innermost” local binding, or the global binding if there is no
local binding.  To be more precise, a rule called the <dfn>scoping
rule</dfn> determines where in a program a local binding takes effect.  The
default scoping rule in Emacs Lisp is called <dfn>dynamic scoping</dfn>,
which simply states that the current binding at any given point in the
execution of a program is the most recently-created binding for that
variable that still exists.  For details about dynamic scoping, and an
alternative scoping rule called <dfn>lexical scoping</dfn>, See <a href="Variable-Scoping.html#Variable-Scoping">Variable Scoping</a>.

   </p><p>The special forms <code>let</code> and <code>let*</code> exist to create local
bindings:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/let"></a><a name="DASH-1240"></a>— Special Form: <b>let</b> (<var>bindings<small class="dots">...</small></var>)<var> forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-let-632"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form sets up local bindings for a certain set of
variables, as specified by <var>bindings</var>, and then evaluates all of
the <var>forms</var> in textual order.  Its return value is the value of
the last form in <var>forms</var>.

        </p><p>Each of the <var>bindings</var> is either (i)&nbsp;a<!-- /@w --> symbol, in which case
that symbol is locally bound to <code>nil</code>; or (ii)&nbsp;a<!-- /@w --> list of the
form <code>(</code><var>symbol</var> <var>value-form</var><code>)</code>, in which case
<var>symbol</var> is locally bound to the result of evaluating
<var>value-form</var>.  If <var>value-form</var> is omitted, <code>nil</code> is used.

        </p><p>All of the <var>value-form</var>s in <var>bindings</var> are evaluated in the
order they appear and <em>before</em> binding any of the symbols to them. 
Here is an example of this: <code>z</code> is bound to the old value of
<code>y</code>, which is 2, not the new value of <code>y</code>, which is 1.

     </p><pre class="example">          (setq y 2)
               ⇒ 2
          
          (let ((y 1)
                (z y))
            (list y z))
               ⇒ (1 2)
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/let%2A"></a><a name="DASH-1241"></a>— Special Form: <b>let*</b> (<var>bindings<small class="dots">...</small></var>)<var> forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-let_002a-633"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form is like <code>let</code>, but it binds each variable right
after computing its local value, before computing the local value for
the next variable.  Therefore, an expression in <var>bindings</var> can
refer to the preceding symbols bound in this <code>let*</code> form. 
Compare the following example with the example above for <code>let</code>.

     </p><pre class="example">          (setq y 2)
               ⇒ 2
          
          (let* ((y 1)
                 (z y))    ; <span class="roman">Use the just-established value of </span><code>y</code><span class="roman">.</span>
            (list y z))
               ⇒ (1 1)
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>Here is a complete list of the other facilities that create local
bindings:

     </p><ul>
<li>Function calls (see <a href="Functions.html#Functions">Functions</a>).

     </li><li>Macro calls (see <a href="Macros.html#Macros">Macros</a>).

     </li><li><code>condition-case</code> (see <a href="Errors.html#Errors">Errors</a>). 
</li></ul>

   <p>Variables can also have buffer-local bindings (see <a href="Buffer_002dLocal-Variables.html#Buffer_002dLocal-Variables">Buffer-Local Variables</a>); a few variables have terminal-local bindings
(see <a href="Multiple-Terminals.html#Multiple-Terminals">Multiple Terminals</a>).  These kinds of bindings work somewhat
like ordinary local bindings, but they are localized depending on
“where” you are in Emacs.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/max%2Dspecpdl%2Dsize"></a><a name="DASH-1242"></a>— User Option: <b>max-specpdl-size</b><var><a name="index-max_002dspecpdl_002dsize-634"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="Definition-of-max_002dspecpdl_002dsize"></a><a name="index-variable-limit-error-635"></a><a name="index-evaluation-error-636"></a><a name="index-infinite-recursion-637"></a>This variable defines the limit on the total number of local variable
bindings and <code>unwind-protect</code> cleanups (see <a href="Cleanups.html#Cleanups">Cleaning Up from Nonlocal Exits</a>) that are allowed before Emacs
signals an error (with data <code>"Variable binding depth exceeds
max-specpdl-size"</code>).

        </p><p>This limit, with the associated error when it is exceeded, is one way
that Lisp avoids infinite recursion on an ill-defined function. 
<code>max-lisp-eval-depth</code> provides another limit on depth of nesting. 
See <a href="Definition-of-max_002dlisp_002deval_002ddepth.html#Definition-of-max_002dlisp_002deval_002ddepth">Eval</a>.

        </p><p>The default value is 1300.  Entry to the Lisp debugger increases the
value, if there is little room left, to make sure the debugger itself
has room to execute.
