<h3 class="section">19.8 Asking Multiple Y-or-N Questions</h3>

<p>When you have a series of similar questions to ask, such as “Do you
want to save this buffer” for each buffer in turn, you should use
<code>map-y-or-n-p</code> to ask the collection of questions, rather than
asking each question individually.  This gives the user certain
convenient facilities such as the ability to answer the whole series at
once.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/map%2Dy%2Dor%2Dn%2Dp"></a><a name="DASH-1458"></a>— Function: <b>map-y-or-n-p</b><var> prompter actor list &amp;optional help action-alist no-cursor-in-echo-area<a name="index-map_002dy_002dor_002dn_002dp-1243"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function asks the user a series of questions, reading a
single-character answer in the echo area for each one.

        </p><p>The value of <var>list</var> specifies the objects to ask questions about. 
It should be either a list of objects or a generator function.  If it is
a function, it should expect no arguments, and should return either the
next object to ask about, or <code>nil</code>, meaning to stop asking questions.

        </p><p>The argument <var>prompter</var> specifies how to ask each question.  If
<var>prompter</var> is a string, the question text is computed like this:

     </p><pre class="example">          (format <var>prompter</var> <var>object</var>)
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">where <var>object</var> is the next object to ask about (as obtained from
<var>list</var>).

        </p><p>If not a string, <var>prompter</var> should be a function of one argument
(the next object to ask about) and should return the question text.  If
the value is a string, that is the question to ask the user.  The
function can also return <code>t</code>, meaning do act on this object (and
don't ask the user), or <code>nil</code>, meaning ignore this object (and don't
ask the user).

        </p><p>The argument <var>actor</var> says how to act on the answers that the user
gives.  It should be a function of one argument, and it is called with
each object that the user says yes for.  Its argument is always an
object obtained from <var>list</var>.

        </p><p>If the argument <var>help</var> is given, it should be a list of this form:

     </p><pre class="example">          (<var>singular</var> <var>plural</var> <var>action</var>)
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">where <var>singular</var> is a string containing a singular noun that
describes the objects conceptually being acted on, <var>plural</var> is the
corresponding plural noun, and <var>action</var> is a transitive verb
describing what <var>actor</var> does.

        </p><p>If you don't specify <var>help</var>, the default is <code>("object"
"objects" "act on")</code>.

        </p><p>Each time a question is asked, the user may enter <kbd>y</kbd>, <kbd>Y</kbd>, or
&lt;SPC&gt; to act on that object; <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>N</kbd>, or &lt;DEL&gt; to skip
that object; <kbd>!</kbd> to act on all following objects; &lt;ESC&gt; or
<kbd>q</kbd> to exit (skip all following objects); <kbd>.</kbd> (period) to act on
the current object and then exit; or <kbd>C-h</kbd> to get help.  These are
the same answers that <code>query-replace</code> accepts.  The keymap
<code>query-replace-map</code> defines their meaning for <code>map-y-or-n-p</code>
as well as for <code>query-replace</code>; see <a href="Search-and-Replace.html#Search-and-Replace">Search and Replace</a>.

        </p><p>You can use <var>action-alist</var> to specify additional possible answers
and what they mean.  It is an alist of elements of the form
<code>(</code><var>char</var> <var>function</var> <var>help</var><code>)</code>, each of which defines one
additional answer.  In this element, <var>char</var> is a character (the
answer); <var>function</var> is a function of one argument (an object from
<var>list</var>); <var>help</var> is a string.

        </p><p>When the user responds with <var>char</var>, <code>map-y-or-n-p</code> calls
<var>function</var>.  If it returns non-<code>nil</code>, the object is considered
“acted upon”, and <code>map-y-or-n-p</code> advances to the next object in
<var>list</var>.  If it returns <code>nil</code>, the prompt is repeated for the
same object.

        </p><p>Normally, <code>map-y-or-n-p</code> binds <code>cursor-in-echo-area</code> while
prompting.  But if <var>no-cursor-in-echo-area</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it
does not do that.

        </p><p>If <code>map-y-or-n-p</code> is called in a command that was invoked using the
mouse—more precisely, if <code>last-nonmenu-event</code> (see <a href="Command-Loop-Info.html#Command-Loop-Info">Command Loop Info</a>) is either <code>nil</code> or a list—then it uses a dialog box
or pop-up menu to ask the question.  In this case, it does not use
keyboard input or the echo area.  You can force use either of the mouse or
of keyboard input by binding <code>last-nonmenu-event</code> to a suitable
value around the call.

        </p><p>The return value of <code>map-y-or-n-p</code> is the number of objects acted on.
