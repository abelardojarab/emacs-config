<h3 class="section">26.4 Buffer File Name</h3>

<p><a name="index-visited-file-2155"></a><a name="index-buffer-file-name-2156"></a><a name="index-file-name-of-buffer-2157"></a>
  The <dfn>buffer file name</dfn> is the name of the file that is visited in
that buffer.  When a buffer is not visiting a file, its buffer file name
is <code>nil</code>.  Most of the time, the buffer name is the same as the
nondirectory part of the buffer file name, but the buffer file name and
the buffer name are distinct and can be set independently. 
See <a href="Visiting-Files.html#Visiting-Files">Visiting Files</a>.

<blockquote><p>This function returns the absolute file name of the file that
<var>buffer</var> is visiting.  If <var>buffer</var> is not visiting any file,
<code>buffer-file-name</code> returns <code>nil</code>.  If <var>buffer</var> is not
supplied, it defaults to the current buffer.

        <p>It is risky to change this variable's value without doing various other
things.  Normally it is better to use <code>set-visited-file-name</code> (see
below); some of the things done there, such as changing the buffer name,
are not strictly necessary, but others are essential to avoid confusing
Emacs.

all files accessible on the system.  See the function
<code>file-attributes</code>, in <a href="File-Attributes.html#File-Attributes">File Attributes</a>, for more information
about them.

<blockquote><p>This function returns the buffer visiting file <var>filename</var>.  If
there is no such buffer, it returns <code>nil</code>.  The argument
<var>filename</var>, which must be a string, is expanded (see <a href="File-Name-Expansion.html#File-Name-Expansion">File Name Expansion</a>), then compared against the visited file names of all live
buffers.  Note that the buffer's <code>buffer-file-name</code> must match
the expansion of <var>filename</var> exactly.  This function will not
recognize other names for the same file.

<blockquote><p>This is like <code>get-file-buffer</code>, except that it can return any
buffer visiting the file <em>possibly under a different name</em>.  That
is, the buffer's <code>buffer-file-name</code> does not need to match the
expansion of <var>filename</var> exactly, it only needs to refer to the
same file.  If <var>predicate</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it should be a
function of one argument, a buffer visiting <var>filename</var>.  The
buffer is only considered a suitable return value if <var>predicate</var>
returns non-<code>nil</code>.  If it can not find a suitable buffer to
return, <code>find-buffer-visiting</code> returns <code>nil</code>.

<blockquote><p>If <var>filename</var> is a non-empty string, this function changes the
name of the file visited in the current buffer to <var>filename</var>.  (If the
buffer had no visited file, this gives it one.)  The <em>next time</em>
the buffer is saved it will go in the newly-specified file.

        </p><p>This command marks the buffer as modified, since it does not (as far
as Emacs knows) match the contents of <var>filename</var>, even if it
matched the former visited file.  It also renames the buffer to
correspond to the new file name, unless the new name is already in
use.

        </p><p>If <var>filename</var> is <code>nil</code> or the empty string, that stands for
“no visited file”.  In this case, <code>set-visited-file-name</code> marks
the buffer as having no visited file, without changing the buffer's
modified flag.

        </p><p>Normally, this function asks the user for confirmation if there
already is a buffer visiting <var>filename</var>.  If <var>no-query</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, that prevents asking this question.  If there already
is a buffer visiting <var>filename</var>, and the user confirms or
<var>no-query</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this function makes the new
buffer name unique by appending a number inside of ‘<samp><span class="samp">&lt;...&gt;</span></samp>’ to
<var>filename</var>.

        </p><p>If <var>along-with-file</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, that means to assume that
the former visited file has been renamed to <var>filename</var>.  In this
case, the command does not change the buffer's modified flag, nor the
buffer's recorded last file modification time as reported by
<code>visited-file-modtime</code> (see <a href="Modification-Time.html#Modification-Time">Modification Time</a>).  If
<var>along-with-file</var> is <code>nil</code>, this function clears the recorded
last file modification time, after which <code>visited-file-modtime</code>
returns zero.

        </p><p>When the function <code>set-visited-file-name</code> is called
interactively, it prompts for <var>filename</var> in the minibuffer.
