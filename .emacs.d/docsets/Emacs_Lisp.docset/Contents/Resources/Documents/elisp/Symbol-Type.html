<h4 class="subsection">2.3.4 Symbol Type</h4>

<p>A <dfn>symbol</dfn> in GNU Emacs Lisp is an object with a name.  The
symbol name serves as the printed representation of the symbol.  In
ordinary Lisp use, with one single obarray (see <a href="Creating-Symbols.html#Creating-Symbols">Creating Symbols</a>),
a symbol's name is unique&mdash;no two symbols have the same name.

   <p>A symbol can serve as a variable, as a function name, or to hold a
property list.  Or it may serve only to be distinct from all other Lisp
objects, so that its presence in a data structure may be recognized
reliably.  In a given context, usually only one of these uses is
intended.  But you can use one symbol in all of these ways,
independently.

   <p>A symbol whose name starts with a colon (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;) is called a
<dfn>keyword symbol</dfn>.  These symbols automatically act as constants,
and are normally used only by comparing an unknown symbol with a few
specific alternatives.  See <a href="Constant-Variables.html#Constant-Variables">Constant Variables</a>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005c_007d-in-symbols-84"></a><a name="index-backslash-in-symbols-85"></a>  A symbol name can contain any characters whatever.  Most symbol names
are written with letters, digits, and the punctuation characters
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-+=*/</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Such names require no special punctuation; the characters
of the name suffice as long as the name does not look like a number. 
(If it does, write a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning of the name to force
interpretation as a symbol.)  The characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_~!@$%^&amp;:&lt;&gt;{}?</span></samp>&rsquo; are
less often used but also require no special punctuation.  Any other
characters may be included in a symbol's name by escaping them with a
backslash.  In contrast to its use in strings, however, a backslash in
the name of a symbol simply quotes the single character that follows the
backslash.  For example, in a string, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\t</span></samp>&rsquo; represents a tab
character; in the name of a symbol, however, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\t</span></samp>&rsquo; merely quotes the
letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo;.  To have a symbol with a tab character in its name, you
must actually use a tab (preceded with a backslash).  But it's rare to
do such a thing.

   <p><a name="index-CL-note_002d_002d_002dcase-of-letters-86"></a><blockquote>
<b>Common Lisp note:</b> In Common Lisp, lower case letters are always
&ldquo;folded&rdquo; to upper case, unless they are explicitly escaped.  In Emacs
Lisp, upper case and lower case letters are distinct. 
</blockquote>

   <p>Here are several examples of symbol names.  Note that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; in
the fourth example is escaped to prevent it from being read as a number. 
This is not necessary in the sixth example because the rest of the name
makes it invalid as a number.

<pre class="example">     foo                 ; <span class="roman">A symbol named &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;.</span>
     FOO                 ; <span class="roman">A symbol named &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;, different from &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;.</span>
     1+                  ; <span class="roman">A symbol named &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">1+</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;</span>
                         ;   <span class="roman">(not &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">+1</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;, which is an integer).</span>
     \+1                 ; <span class="roman">A symbol named &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">+1</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;</span>
                         ;   <span class="roman">(not a very readable name).</span>
     \(*\ 1\ 2\)         ; <span class="roman">A symbol named &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">(* 1 2)</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo; (a worse name).</span>
     <!-- the @'s in this next line use up three characters, hence the -->
     <!-- apparent misalignment of the comment. -->
     +-*/_~!@$%^&amp;=:&lt;&gt;{}  ; <span class="roman">A symbol named &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">+-*/_~!@$%^&amp;=:&lt;&gt;{}</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;.</span>
                         ;   <span class="roman">These characters need not be escaped.</span>
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0023_0023_007d-read-syntax-87"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0023_003a_007d-read-syntax-88"></a>  As an exception to the rule that a symbol's name serves as its
printed representation, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">##</span></samp>&rsquo; is the printed representation for an
interned symbol whose name is an empty string.  Furthermore,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#:</span><var>foo</var></samp>&rsquo; is the printed representation for an uninterned
symbol whose name is <var>foo</var>.  (Normally, the Lisp reader interns
all symbols; see <a href="Creating-Symbols.html#Creating-Symbols">Creating Symbols</a>.)
