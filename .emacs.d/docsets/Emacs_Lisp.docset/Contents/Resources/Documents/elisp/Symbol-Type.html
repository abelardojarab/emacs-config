<h4 class="subsection">2.3.4 Symbol Type</h4>

<p>A <em>symbol</em> in GNU Emacs Lisp is an object with a name.  The
symbol name serves as the printed representation of the symbol.  In
ordinary Lisp use, with one single obarray (see <a href="Creating-Symbols.html#Creating-Symbols">Creating Symbols</a>),
a symbol&rsquo;s name is unique&mdash;no two symbols have the same name.
</p>
<p>A symbol can serve as a variable, as a function name, or to hold a
property list.  Or it may serve only to be distinct from all other Lisp
objects, so that its presence in a data structure may be recognized
reliably.  In a given context, usually only one of these uses is
intended.  But you can use one symbol in all of these ways,
independently.
</p>
<p>A symbol whose name starts with a colon (&lsquo;<samp>:</samp>&rsquo;) is called a
<em>keyword symbol</em>.  These symbols automatically act as constants,
and are normally used only by comparing an unknown symbol with a few
specific alternatives.  See <a href="Constant-Variables.html#Constant-Variables">Constant Variables</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-_005c-in-symbols"></a>
<a name="index-backslash-in-symbols"></a>
<p>A symbol name can contain any characters whatever.  Most symbol names
are written with letters, digits, and the punctuation characters
&lsquo;<samp>-+=*/</samp>&rsquo;.  Such names require no special punctuation; the characters
of the name suffice as long as the name does not look like a number.
(If it does, write a &lsquo;<samp>\</samp>&rsquo; at the beginning of the name to force
interpretation as a symbol.)  The characters &lsquo;<samp>_~!@$%^&amp;:&lt;&gt;{}?</samp>&rsquo; are
less often used but also require no special punctuation.  Any other
characters may be included in a symbol&rsquo;s name by escaping them with a
backslash.  In contrast to its use in strings, however, a backslash in
the name of a symbol simply quotes the single character that follows the
backslash.  For example, in a string, &lsquo;<samp>\t</samp>&rsquo; represents a tab
character; in the name of a symbol, however, &lsquo;<samp>\t</samp>&rsquo; merely quotes the
letter &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo;.  To have a symbol with a tab character in its name, you
must actually use a tab (preceded with a backslash).  But it&rsquo;s rare to
do such a thing.
</p>
<a name="index-CL-note_002d_002d_002dcase-of-letters"></a>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Common Lisp note:</b> In Common Lisp, lower case letters are always
folded to upper case, unless they are explicitly escaped.  In Emacs
Lisp, upper case and lower case letters are distinct.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here are several examples of symbol names.  Note that the &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo; in
the fourth example is escaped to prevent it from being read as a number.
This is not necessary in the sixth example because the rest of the name
makes it invalid as a number.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">foo                 ; <span class="roman">A symbol named &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo;.</span>
FOO                 ; <span class="roman">A symbol named &lsquo;<samp>FOO</samp>&rsquo;, different from &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo;.</span>
</pre><pre class="example">1+                  ; <span class="roman">A symbol named &lsquo;<samp>1+</samp>&rsquo;</span>
                    ;   <span class="roman">(not &lsquo;<samp>+1</samp>&rsquo;, which is an integer).</span>
</pre><pre class="example">\+1                 ; <span class="roman">A symbol named &lsquo;<samp>+1</samp>&rsquo;</span>
                    ;   <span class="roman">(not a very readable name).</span>
</pre><pre class="example">\(*\ 1\ 2\)         ; <span class="roman">A symbol named &lsquo;<samp>(* 1 2)</samp>&rsquo; (a worse name).</span>
+-*/_~!@$%^&amp;=:&lt;&gt;{}  ; <span class="roman">A symbol named &lsquo;<samp>+-*/_~!@$%^&amp;=:&lt;&gt;{}</samp>&rsquo;.</span>
                    ;   <span class="roman">These characters need not be escaped.</span>
</pre></div>

<p>As an exception to the rule that a symbol&rsquo;s name serves as its
printed representation, &lsquo;<samp>##</samp>&rsquo; is the printed representation for an
interned symbol whose name is an empty string.  Furthermore,
&lsquo;<samp>#:<var>foo</var></samp>&rsquo; is the printed representation for an uninterned
symbol whose name is <var>foo</var>.  (Normally, the Lisp reader interns
all symbols; see <a href="Creating-Symbols.html#Creating-Symbols">Creating Symbols</a>.)
