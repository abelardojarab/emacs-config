<h4 class="subsection">34.2.2 Syntax Flags</h4>

<p><a name="index-syntax-flags-3473"></a>
  In addition to the classes, entries for characters in a syntax table
can specify flags.  There are eight possible flags, represented by the
characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>All the flags except &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; are used to describe comment
delimiters.  The digit flags are used for comment delimiters made up
of 2 characters.  They indicate that a character can <em>also</em> be
part of a comment sequence, in addition to the syntactic properties
associated with its character class.  The flags are independent of the
class and each other for the sake of characters such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in
C mode, which is a punctuation character, <em>and</em> the second
character of a start-of-comment sequence (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>&rsquo;), <em>and</em> the
first character of an end-of-comment sequence (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*/</span></samp>&rsquo;).  The flags
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; are used to qualify the corresponding
comment delimiter.

   <p>Here is a table of the possible flags for a character <var>c</var>,
and what they mean:

     <ul>
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; means <var>c</var> is the start of a two-character comment-start
sequence.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo; means <var>c</var> is the second character of such a sequence.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3</span></samp>&rsquo; means <var>c</var> is the start of a two-character comment-end
sequence.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4</span></samp>&rsquo; means <var>c</var> is the second character of such a sequence.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; means that <var>c</var> as a comment delimiter belongs to the
alternative &ldquo;b&rdquo; comment style.  For a two-character comment starter,
this flag is only significant on the second char, and for a 2-character
comment ender it is only significant on the first char.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; means that <var>c</var> as a comment delimiter belongs to the
alternative &ldquo;c&rdquo; comment style.  For a two-character comment
delimiter, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; on either character makes it of style &ldquo;c&rdquo;.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; on a comment delimiter character specifies
that this kind of comment can be nested.  For a two-character
comment delimiter, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; on either character makes it
nestable.

     <p><a name="index-comment-style-3474"></a>Emacs supports several comment styles simultaneously in any one syntax
table.  A comment style is a set of flags &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, so there can be up to 8 different comment styles. 
Each comment delimiter has a style and only matches comment delimiters
of the same style.  Thus if a comment starts with the comment-start
sequence of style &ldquo;bn&rdquo;, it will extend until the next matching
comment-end sequence of style &ldquo;bn&rdquo;.

     <p>The appropriate comment syntax settings for C++ can be as follows:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">124</span></samp>&rsquo;
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">23b</span></samp>&rsquo;
<br><dt>newline<dd>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
</dl>

     <p>This defines four comment-delimiting sequences:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is a comment-start sequence for &ldquo;b&rdquo; style because the
second character, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, has the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; flag.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">//</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is a comment-start sequence for &ldquo;a&rdquo; style because the second
character, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;, does not have the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; flag.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*/</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is a comment-end sequence for &ldquo;b&rdquo; style because the first
character, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, has the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; flag.

          <br><dt>newline<dd>This is a comment-end sequence for &ldquo;a&rdquo; style, because the newline
character does not have the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; flag. 
</dl>

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; identifies an additional &ldquo;prefix character&rdquo; for Lisp syntax. 
These characters are treated as whitespace when they appear between
expressions.  When they appear within an expression, they are handled
according to their usual syntax classes.

     <p>The function <code>backward-prefix-chars</code> moves back over these
characters, as well as over characters whose primary syntax class is
prefix (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo;).  See <a href="Motion-and-Syntax.html#Motion-and-Syntax">Motion and Syntax</a>. 
</ul>
