<h4 class="subsection">32.10.1 Basic Concepts of Coding Systems</h4>

<p><a name="index-character-code-conversion-3250"></a>  <dfn>Character code conversion</dfn> involves conversion between the
internal representation of characters used inside Emacs and some other
encoding.  Emacs supports many different encodings, in that it can
convert to and from them.  For example, it can convert text to or from
encodings such as Latin 1, Latin 2, Latin 3, Latin 4, Latin 5, and
several variants of ISO 2022.  In some cases, Emacs supports several
alternative encodings for the same characters; for example, there are
three coding systems for the Cyrillic (Russian) alphabet: ISO,
Alternativnyj, and KOI8.

   </p><p>Every coding system specifies a particular set of character code
conversions, but the coding system <code>undecided</code> is special: it
leaves the choice unspecified, to be chosen heuristically for each
file, based on the file's data.

   </p><p>In general, a coding system doesn't guarantee roundtrip identity:
decoding a byte sequence using coding system, then encoding the
resulting text in the same coding system, can produce a different byte
sequence.  But some coding systems do guarantee that the byte sequence
will be the same as what you originally decoded.  Here are a few
examples:

   </p><blockquote>
iso-8859-1, utf-8, big5, shift_jis, euc-jp
</blockquote>

   <p>Encoding buffer text and then decoding the result can also fail to
reproduce the original text.  For instance, if you encode a character
with a coding system which does not support that character, the result
is unpredictable, and thus decoding it using the same coding system
may produce a different text.  Currently, Emacs can't report errors
that result from encoding unsupported characters.

   </p><p><a name="index-EOL-conversion-3251"></a><a name="index-end_002dof_002dline-conversion-3252"></a><a name="index-line-end-conversion-3253"></a>  <dfn>End of line conversion</dfn> handles three different conventions
used on various systems for representing end of line in files.  The
Unix convention, used on GNU and Unix systems, is to use the linefeed
character (also called newline).  The DOS convention, used on
MS-Windows and MS-DOS systems, is to use a carriage-return and a
linefeed at the end of a line.  The Mac convention is to use just
carriage-return.  (This was the convention used on the Macintosh
system prior to OS X.)

   </p><p><a name="index-base-coding-system-3254"></a><a name="index-variant-coding-system-3255"></a>  <dfn>Base coding systems</dfn> such as <code>latin-1</code> leave the end-of-line
conversion unspecified, to be chosen based on the data.  <dfn>Variant
coding systems</dfn> such as <code>latin-1-unix</code>, <code>latin-1-dos</code> and
<code>latin-1-mac</code> specify the end-of-line conversion explicitly as
well.  Most base coding systems have three corresponding variants whose
names are formed by adding ‘<samp><span class="samp">-unix</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">-dos</span></samp>’ and ‘<samp><span class="samp">-mac</span></samp>’.

   </p><p><a name="index-raw_002dtext_0040r_007b-coding-system_007d-3256"></a>  The coding system <code>raw-text</code> is special in that it prevents
character code conversion, and causes the buffer visited with this
coding system to be a unibyte buffer.  For historical reasons, you can
save both unibyte and multibyte text with this coding system.  When
you use <code>raw-text</code> to encode multibyte text, it does perform one
character code conversion: it converts eight-bit characters to their
single-byte external representation.  <code>raw-text</code> does not specify
the end-of-line conversion, allowing that to be determined as usual by
the data, and has the usual three variants which specify the
end-of-line conversion.

   </p><p><a name="index-no_002dconversion_0040r_007b-coding-system_007d-3257"></a><a name="index-binary_0040r_007b-coding-system_007d-3258"></a>  <code>no-conversion</code> (and its alias <code>binary</code>) is equivalent to
<code>raw-text-unix</code>: it specifies no conversion of either character
codes or end-of-line.

   </p><p><a name="index-emacs_002dinternal_0040r_007b-coding-system_007d-3259"></a><a name="index-utf_002d8_002demacs_0040r_007b-coding-system_007d-3260"></a>  The coding system <code>utf-8-emacs</code> specifies that the data is
represented in the internal Emacs encoding (see <a href="Text-Representations.html#Text-Representations">Text Representations</a>).  This is like <code>raw-text</code> in that no code
conversion happens, but different in that the result is multibyte
data.  The name <code>emacs-internal</code> is an alias for
<code>utf-8-emacs</code>.

purposes, but one that you might find useful is <code>:mime-charset</code>. 
That property's value is the name used in MIME for the character coding
which this coding system can read and write.  Examples:

     </p><pre class="example">          (coding-system-get 'iso-latin-1 :mime-charset)
               ⇒ iso-8859-1

               ⇒ iso-2022-cn
          (coding-system-get 'cyrillic-koi8 :mime-charset)
               ⇒ koi8-r
</pre>
        <p>The value of the <code>:mime-charset</code> property is also defined
as an alias for the coding system.
