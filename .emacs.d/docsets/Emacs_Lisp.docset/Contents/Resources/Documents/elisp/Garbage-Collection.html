<h3 class="section">E.3 Garbage Collection</h3>

<p><a name="index-memory-allocation-4415"></a>  When a program creates a list or the user defines a new function
(such as by loading a library), that data is placed in normal storage. 
If normal storage runs low, then Emacs asks the operating system to
allocate more memory.  Different types of Lisp objects, such as
symbols, cons cells, small vectors, markers, etc., are segregated in
distinct blocks in memory.  (Large vectors, long strings, buffers and
certain other editing types, which are fairly large, are allocated in
individual blocks, one per object; small strings are packed into blocks
of 8k bytes, and small vectors are packed into blocks of 4k bytes).

   </p><p><a name="index-vector_002dlike-objects_002c-storage-4416"></a><a name="index-storage-of-vector_002dlike-Lisp-objects-4417"></a>  Beyond the basic vector, a lot of objects like window, buffer, and
frame are managed as if they were vectors.  The corresponding C data
structures include the <code>struct vectorlike_header</code> field whose
<code>size</code> member contains the subtype enumerated by <code>enum pvec_type</code>
and an information about how many <code>Lisp_Object</code> fields this structure
contains and what the size of the rest data is.  This information is
needed to calculate the memory footprint of an object, and used
by the vector allocation code while iterating over the vector blocks.

   </p><p><a name="index-garbage-collection-4418"></a>  It is quite common to use some storage for a while, then release it
by (for example) killing a buffer or deleting the last pointer to an
object.  Emacs provides a <dfn>garbage collector</dfn> to reclaim this
abandoned storage.  The garbage collector operates by finding and
marking all Lisp objects that are still accessible to Lisp programs. 
To begin with, it assumes all the symbols, their values and associated
function definitions, and any data presently on the stack, are
accessible.  Any objects that can be reached indirectly through other
accessible objects are also accessible.

   </p><p>When marking is finished, all objects still unmarked are garbage.  No
matter what the Lisp program or the user does, it is impossible to refer
to them, since there is no longer a way to reach them.  Their space
might as well be reused, since no one will miss them.  The second
(“sweep”) phase of the garbage collector arranges to reuse them.

<!-- ??? Maybe add something describing weak hash tables here? -->
   </p><p><a name="index-free-list-4419"></a>  The sweep phase puts unused cons cells onto a <dfn>free list</dfn>
for future allocation; likewise for symbols and markers.  It compacts
the accessible strings so they occupy fewer 8k blocks; then it frees the
other 8k blocks.  Unreachable vectors from vector blocks are coalesced
to create largest possible free areas; if a free area spans a complete
4k block, that block is freed.  Otherwise, the free area is recorded
in a free list array, where each entry corresponds to a free list
of areas of the same size.  Large vectors, buffers, and other large
objects are allocated and freed individually.

   </p><p><a name="index-CL-note_002d_002d_002dallocate-more-storage-4420"></a></p><blockquote>
<b>Common Lisp note:</b> Unlike other Lisps, GNU Emacs Lisp does not
call the garbage collector when the free list is empty.  Instead, it
simply requests the operating system to allocate more storage, and
processing continues until <code>gc-cons-threshold</code> bytes have been
used.

   <p>This means that you can make sure that the garbage collector will not
run during a certain portion of a Lisp program by calling the garbage
collector explicitly just before it (provided that portion of the
program does not use so much space as to force a second garbage
collection). 
</p></blockquote>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/garbage%2Dcollect"></a><a name="DASH-987"></a>— Command: <b>garbage-collect</b><var><a name="index-garbage_002dcollect-4421"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command runs a garbage collection, and returns information on
the amount of space in use.  (Garbage collection can also occur
spontaneously if you use more than <code>gc-cons-threshold</code> bytes of
Lisp data since the previous garbage collection.)

        </p><p><code>garbage-collect</code> returns a list with information on amount of space in
use, where each entry has the form ‘<samp><span class="samp">(</span><var>name</var> <var>size</var> <var>used</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>’
or ‘<samp><span class="samp">(</span><var>name</var> <var>size</var> <var>used</var> <var>free</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>’.  In the entry,
<var>name</var> is a symbol describing the kind of objects this entry represents,
<var>size</var> is the number of bytes used by each one, <var>used</var> is the number
of those objects that were found live in the heap, and optional <var>free</var> is
the number of those objects that are not live but that Emacs keeps around for
future allocations.  So an overall result is:

<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is the number of bytes of storage that must
be allocated for Lisp objects after one garbage collection in order to
trigger another garbage collection.  You can use the result returned by
<code>garbage-collect</code> to get an information about size of the particular
object type; space allocated to the contents of buffers does not count. 
Note that the subsequent garbage collection does not happen immediately
when the threshold is exhausted, but only the next time the Lisp interpreter
is called.

        </p><p>The initial threshold value is <code>GC_DEFAULT_THRESHOLD</code>, defined in
<samp><span class="file">alloc.c</span></samp>.  Since it's defined in <code>word_size</code> units, the value
is 400,000 for the default 32-bit configuration and 800,000 for the 64-bit
one.  If you specify a larger value, garbage collection will happen less
often.  This reduces the amount of time spent garbage collecting, but
increases total memory use.  You may want to do this when running a program
that creates lots of Lisp data.

        </p><p>You can make collections more frequent by specifying a smaller value, down
to 1/10th of <code>GC_DEFAULT_THRESHOLD</code>.  A value less than this minimum
will remain in effect only until the subsequent garbage collection, at which
time <code>garbage-collect</code> will set the threshold back to the minimum.
