<h3 class="section">8.1 Symbol Components</h3>

<p><a name="index-symbol-components-481"></a>
  Each symbol has four components (or &ldquo;cells&rdquo;), each of which
references another object:

     <dl>
<dt>Print name<dd><a name="index-print-name-cell-482"></a>The symbol's name.

     <br><dt>Value<dd><a name="index-value-cell-483"></a>The symbol's current value as a variable.

     <br><dt>Function<dd><a name="index-function-cell-484"></a>The symbol's function definition.  It can also hold a symbol, a
keymap, or a keyboard macro.

     <br><dt>Property list<dd><a name="index-property-list-cell-485"></a>The symbol's property list. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">The print name cell always holds a string, and cannot be changed. 
Each of the other three cells can be set to any Lisp object.

   <p>The print name cell holds the string that is the name of a symbol. 
Since symbols are represented textually by their names, it is
important not to have two symbols with the same name.  The Lisp reader
ensures this: every time it reads a symbol, it looks for an existing
symbol with the specified name before it creates a new one.  To get a
symbol's name, use the function <code>symbol-name</code> (see <a href="Creating-Symbols.html#Creating-Symbols">Creating Symbols</a>).

   <p>The value cell holds a symbol's value as a variable, which is what
you get if the symbol itself is evaluated as a Lisp expression. 
See <a href="Variables.html#Variables">Variables</a>, for details about how values are set and retrieved,
including complications such as <dfn>local bindings</dfn> and <dfn>scoping
rules</dfn>.  Most symbols can have any Lisp object as a value, but certain
special symbols have values that cannot be changed; these include
<code>nil</code> and <code>t</code>, and any symbol whose name starts with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; (those are called <dfn>keywords</dfn>).  See <a href="Constant-Variables.html#Constant-Variables">Constant Variables</a>.

   <p>The function cell holds a symbol's function definition.  Often, we
refer to &ldquo;the function <code>foo</code>&rdquo; when we really mean the function
stored in the function cell of <code>foo</code>; we make the distinction
explicit only when necessary.  Typically, the function cell is used to
hold a function (see <a href="Functions.html#Functions">Functions</a>) or a macro (see <a href="Macros.html#Macros">Macros</a>). 
However, it can also be used to hold a symbol (see <a href="Function-Indirection.html#Function-Indirection">Function Indirection</a>), keyboard macro (see <a href="Keyboard-Macros.html#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>), keymap
(see <a href="Keymaps.html#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>), or autoload object (see <a href="Autoloading.html#Autoloading">Autoloading</a>).  To get
the contents of a symbol's function cell, use the function
<code>symbol-function</code> (see <a href="Function-Cells.html#Function-Cells">Function Cells</a>).

   <p>The property list cell normally should hold a correctly formatted
property list.  To get a symbol's property list, use the function
<code>symbol-plist</code>.  See <a href="Symbol-Properties.html#Symbol-Properties">Symbol Properties</a>.

   <p>The function cell or the value cell may be <dfn>void</dfn>, which means
that the cell does not reference any object.  (This is not the same
thing as holding the symbol <code>void</code>, nor the same as holding the
symbol <code>nil</code>.)  Examining a function or value cell that is void
results in an error, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Symbol's value as variable is void</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Because each symbol has separate value and function cells, variables
names and function names do not conflict.  For example, the symbol
<code>buffer-file-name</code> has a value (the name of the file being
visited in the current buffer) as well as a function definition (a
primitive function that returns the name of the file):

<pre class="example">     buffer-file-name
          &rArr; "/gnu/elisp/symbols.texi"
     (symbol-function 'buffer-file-name)
          &rArr; #&lt;subr buffer-file-name&gt;
</pre>
