<h4 class="subsection">22.4.2 The Data Structure of the Mode Line</h4>

<p><a name="index-mode-line-construct-1746"></a>
  The mode line contents are controlled by a data structure called a
<dfn>mode line construct</dfn>, made up of lists, strings, symbols, and
numbers kept in buffer-local variables.  Each data type has a specific
meaning for the mode line appearance, as described below.  The same data
structure is used for constructing frame titles (see <a href="Frame-Titles.html#Frame-Titles">Frame Titles</a>)
and header lines (see <a href="Header-Lines.html#Header-Lines">Header Lines</a>).

   <p>A mode line construct may be as simple as a fixed string of text,
but it usually specifies how to combine fixed strings with variables'
values to construct the text.  Many of these variables are themselves
defined to have mode line constructs as their values.

   <p>Here are the meanings of various data types as mode line constructs:

     
<a name="index-percent-symbol-in-mode-line-1747"></a>
<dl><dt><var>string</var><dd>A string as a mode line construct appears verbatim except for
<code>%</code><dfn>-constructs</dfn> in it.  These stand for substitution of
other data; see <a href="_0025_002dConstructs.html#g_t_0025_002dConstructs">%-Constructs</a>.

     <p>If parts of the string have <code>face</code> properties, they control
display of the text just as they would text in the buffer.  Any
characters which have no <code>face</code> properties are displayed, by
default, in the face <code>mode-line</code> or <code>mode-line-inactive</code>
(see <a href="../emacs/Standard-Faces.html#Standard-Faces">Standard Faces</a>).  The
<code>help-echo</code> and <code>keymap</code> properties in <var>string</var> have
special meanings.  See <a href="Properties-in-Mode.html#Properties-in-Mode">Properties in Mode</a>.

     <br><dt><var>symbol</var><dd>A symbol as a mode line construct stands for its value.  The value of
<var>symbol</var> is used as a mode line construct, in place of <var>symbol</var>. 
However, the symbols <code>t</code> and <code>nil</code> are ignored, as is any
symbol whose value is void.

     <p>There is one exception: if the value of <var>symbol</var> is a string, it is
displayed verbatim: the <code>%</code>-constructs are not recognized.

     <p>Unless <var>symbol</var> is marked as &ldquo;risky&rdquo; (i.e., it has a
non-<code>nil</code> <code>risky-local-variable</code> property), all text
properties specified in <var>symbol</var>'s value are ignored.  This includes
the text properties of strings in <var>symbol</var>'s value, as well as all
<code>:eval</code> and <code>:propertize</code> forms in it.  (The reason for this
is security: non-risky variables could be set automatically from file
variables without prompting the user.)

     <br><dt><code>(</code><var>string</var> <var>rest</var><code>...)</code><dt><code>(</code><var>list</var> <var>rest</var><code>...)</code><dd>A list whose first element is a string or list means to process all the
elements recursively and concatenate the results.  This is the most
common form of mode line construct.

     <br><dt><code>(:eval </code><var>form</var><code>)</code><dd>A list whose first element is the symbol <code>:eval</code> says to evaluate
<var>form</var>, and use the result as a string to display.  Make sure this
evaluation cannot load any files, as doing so could cause infinite
recursion.

     <br><dt><code>(:propertize </code><var>elt</var> <var>props</var><code>...)</code><dd>A list whose first element is the symbol <code>:propertize</code> says to
process the mode line construct <var>elt</var> recursively, then add the text
properties specified by <var>props</var> to the result.  The argument
<var>props</var> should consist of zero or more pairs <var>text-property</var>
<var>value</var>.

     <br><dt><code>(</code><var>symbol</var> <var>then</var> <var>else</var><code>)</code><dd>A list whose first element is a symbol that is not a keyword specifies
a conditional.  Its meaning depends on the value of <var>symbol</var>.  If
<var>symbol</var> has a non-<code>nil</code> value, the second element,
<var>then</var>, is processed recursively as a mode line construct. 
Otherwise, the third element, <var>else</var>, is processed recursively. 
You may omit <var>else</var>; then the mode line construct displays nothing
if the value of <var>symbol</var> is <code>nil</code> or void.

     <br><dt><code>(</code><var>width</var> <var>rest</var><code>...)</code><dd>A list whose first element is an integer specifies truncation or
padding of the results of <var>rest</var>.  The remaining elements
<var>rest</var> are processed recursively as mode line constructs and
concatenated together.  When <var>width</var> is positive, the result is
space filled on the right if its width is less than <var>width</var>.  When
<var>width</var> is negative, the result is truncated on the right to
&minus;<var>width</var> columns if its width exceeds &minus;<var>width</var>.

     <p>For example, the usual way to show what percentage of a buffer is above
the top of the window is to use a list like this: <code>(-3 "%p")</code>.
