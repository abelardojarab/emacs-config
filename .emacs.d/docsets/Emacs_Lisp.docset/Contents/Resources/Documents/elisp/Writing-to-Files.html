<h3 class="section">24.4 Writing to Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-writing-to-files-1917"></a>
  You can write the contents of a buffer, or part of a buffer, directly
to a file on disk using the <code>append-to-file</code> and
<code>write-region</code> functions.  Don't use these functions to write to
files that are being visited; that could cause confusion in the
mechanisms for visiting.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/append%2Dto%2Dfile"></a><a name="DASH-2388"></a>— Command: <b>append-to-file</b><var> start end filename<a name="index-append_002dto_002dfile-1918"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function appends the contents of the region delimited by
<var>start</var> and <var>end</var> in the current buffer to the end of file
<var>filename</var>.  If that file does not exist, it is created.  This
function returns <code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>An error is signaled if <var>filename</var> specifies a nonwritable file,
or a nonexistent file in a directory where files cannot be created.

        </p><p>When called from Lisp, this function is completely equivalent to:

     </p><pre class="example">          (write-region start end filename t)
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/write%2Dregion"></a><a name="DASH-2389"></a>— Command: <b>write-region</b><var> start end filename &amp;optional append visit lockname mustbenew<a name="index-write_002dregion-1919"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function writes the region delimited by <var>start</var> and <var>end</var>
in the current buffer into the file specified by <var>filename</var>.

        </p><p>If <var>start</var> is <code>nil</code>, then the command writes the entire buffer
contents (<em>not</em> just the accessible portion) to the file and
ignores <var>end</var>.

     <!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
        </p><p>If <var>start</var> is a string, then <code>write-region</code> writes or appends
that string, rather than text from the buffer.  <var>end</var> is ignored in
this case.

        </p><p>If <var>append</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then the specified text is appended
to the existing file contents (if any).  If <var>append</var> is a
number, <code>write-region</code> seeks to that byte offset from the start
of the file and writes the data from there.

        </p><p>If <var>mustbenew</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <code>write-region</code> asks
for confirmation if <var>filename</var> names an existing file.  If
<var>mustbenew</var> is the symbol <code>excl</code>, then <code>write-region</code>
does not ask for confirmation, but instead it signals an error
<code>file-already-exists</code> if the file already exists.

        </p><p>The test for an existing file, when <var>mustbenew</var> is <code>excl</code>, uses
a special system feature.  At least for files on a local disk, there is
no chance that some other program could create a file of the same name
before Emacs does, without Emacs's noticing.

        </p><p>If <var>visit</var> is <code>t</code>, then Emacs establishes an association
between the buffer and the file: the buffer is then visiting that file. 
It also sets the last file modification time for the current buffer to
<var>filename</var>'s modtime, and marks the buffer as not modified.  This
feature is used by <code>save-buffer</code>, but you probably should not use
it yourself.

     <!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
        </p><p>If <var>visit</var> is a string, it specifies the file name to visit.  This
way, you can write the data to one file (<var>filename</var>) while recording
the buffer as visiting another file (<var>visit</var>).  The argument
<var>visit</var> is used in the echo area message and also for file locking;
<var>visit</var> is stored in <code>buffer-file-name</code>.  This feature is used
to implement <code>file-precious-flag</code>; don't use it yourself unless you
really know what you're doing.

        </p><p>The optional argument <var>lockname</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, specifies the
file name to use for purposes of locking and unlocking, overriding
<var>filename</var> and <var>visit</var> for that purpose.

        </p><p>The function <code>write-region</code> converts the data which it writes to
the appropriate file formats specified by <code>buffer-file-format</code>
and also calls the functions in the list
<code>write-region-annotate-functions</code>. 
See <a href="Format-Conversion.html#Format-Conversion">Format Conversion</a>.

        </p><p>Normally, <code>write-region</code> displays the message ‘<samp><span class="samp">Wrote
</span><var>filename</var></samp>’ in the echo area.  If <var>visit</var> is neither <code>t</code>
nor <code>nil</code> nor a string, then this message is inhibited.  This
feature is useful for programs that use files for internal purposes,
files that the user does not need to know about.

temporary buffer as the current buffer; then, at the end, it writes the
buffer contents into file <var>file</var>.  It kills the temporary buffer
when finished, restoring the buffer that was current before the
