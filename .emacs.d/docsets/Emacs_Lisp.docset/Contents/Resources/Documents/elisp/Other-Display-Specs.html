<h4 class="subsection">37.16.4 Other Display Specifications</h4>

<p>Here are the other sorts of display specifications that you can use
in the <code>display</code> text property.

     <dl>
<dt><var>string</var><dd>Display <var>string</var> instead of the text that has this property.

     <p>Recursive display specifications are not supported&mdash;<var>string</var>'s
<code>display</code> properties, if any, are not used.

     <br><dt><code>(image . </code><var>image-props</var><code>)</code><dd>This kind of display specification is an image descriptor (see <a href="Images.html#Images">Images</a>). 
When used as a display specification, it means to display the image
instead of the text that has the display specification.

     <br><dt><code>(slice </code><var>x</var> <var>y</var> <var>width</var> <var>height</var><code>)</code><dd>This specification together with <code>image</code> specifies a <dfn>slice</dfn>
(a partial area) of the image to display.  The elements <var>y</var> and
<var>x</var> specify the top left corner of the slice, within the image;
<var>width</var> and <var>height</var> specify the width and height of the
slice.  Integers are numbers of pixels.  A floating-point number
in the range 0.0&ndash;1.0 stands for that fraction of the width or height
of the entire image.

     <br><dt><code>((margin nil) </code><var>string</var><code>)</code><dd>A display specification of this form means to display <var>string</var>
instead of the text that has the display specification, at the same
position as that text.  It is equivalent to using just <var>string</var>,
but it is done as a special case of marginal display (see <a href="Display-Margins.html#Display-Margins">Display Margins</a>).

     <br><dt><code>(left-fringe </code><var>bitmap</var> <span class="roman">[</span><var>face</var><span class="roman">]</span><code>)</code><dt><code>(right-fringe </code><var>bitmap</var> <span class="roman">[</span><var>face</var><span class="roman">]</span><code>)</code><dd>This display specification on any character of a line of text causes
the specified <var>bitmap</var> be displayed in the left or right fringes
for that line, instead of the characters that have the display
specification.  The optional <var>face</var> specifies the colors to be
used for the bitmap.  See <a href="Fringe-Bitmaps.html#Fringe-Bitmaps">Fringe Bitmaps</a>, for the details.

     <br><dt><code>(space-width </code><var>factor</var><code>)</code><dd>This display specification affects all the space characters within the
text that has the specification.  It displays all of these spaces
<var>factor</var> times as wide as normal.  The element <var>factor</var> should
be an integer or float.  Characters other than spaces are not affected
at all; in particular, this has no effect on tab characters.

     <br><dt><code>(height </code><var>height</var><code>)</code><dd>This display specification makes the text taller or shorter. 
Here are the possibilities for <var>height</var>:

          <dl>
<dt><code>(+ </code><var>n</var><code>)</code><dd><!-- FIXME: Add an index for "step"?  -xfq -->
This means to use a font that is <var>n</var> steps larger.  A &ldquo;step&rdquo; is
defined by the set of available fonts&mdash;specifically, those that match
what was otherwise specified for this text, in all attributes except
height.  Each size for which a suitable font is available counts as
another step.  <var>n</var> should be an integer.

          <br><dt><code>(- </code><var>n</var><code>)</code><dd>This means to use a font that is <var>n</var> steps smaller.

          <br><dt>a number, <var>factor</var><dd>A number, <var>factor</var>, means to use a font that is <var>factor</var> times
as tall as the default font.

          <br><dt>a symbol, <var>function</var><dd>A symbol is a function to compute the height.  It is called with the
current height as argument, and should return the new height to use.

          <br><dt>anything else, <var>form</var><dd>If the <var>height</var> value doesn't fit the previous possibilities, it is
a form.  Emacs evaluates it to get the new height, with the symbol
<code>height</code> bound to the current specified font height. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>(raise </code><var>factor</var><code>)</code><dd>This kind of display specification raises or lowers the text
it applies to, relative to the baseline of the line.

     <p><var>factor</var> must be a number, which is interpreted as a multiple of the
height of the affected text.  If it is positive, that means to display
the characters raised.  If it is negative, that means to display them
lower down.

     <p>If the text also has a <code>height</code> display specification, that does
not affect the amount of raising or lowering, which is based on the
faces used for the text. 
</dl>

<!-- We put all the `@code{(when ...)}' on one line to encourage -->
<!-- makeinfo's end-of-sentence heuristics to DTRT.  Previously, the dot -->
<!-- was at eol; the info file ended up w/ two spaces rendered after it. -->
   <p>You can make any display specification conditional.  To do that,
package it in another list of the form
<code>(when </code><var>condition</var><code> . </code><var>spec</var><code>)</code>. 
Then the specification <var>spec</var> applies only when
<var>condition</var> evaluates to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  During the
evaluation, <code>object</code> is bound to the string or buffer having the
conditional <code>display</code> property.  <code>position</code> and
<code>buffer-position</code> are bound to the position within <code>object</code>
and the buffer position where the <code>display</code> property was found,
respectively.  Both positions can be different when <code>object</code> is a
string.
