<h4 class="subsubsection">2.3.8.3 Nonprinting Characters in Strings</h4>

<p>You can use the same backslash escape-sequences in a string constant
as in character literals (but do not use the question mark that begins a
character constant).  For example, you can write a string containing the
nonprinting characters tab and <kbd>C-a</kbd>, with commas and spaces between
them, like this: <code>&quot;\t, \C-a&quot;</code>.  See <a href="Character-Type.html#Character-Type">Character Type</a>, for a
description of the read syntax for characters.
</p>
<p>However, not all of the characters you can write with backslash
escape-sequences are valid in strings.  The only control characters that
a string can hold are the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters.  Strings do not
distinguish case in <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters.
</p>
<p>Properly speaking, strings cannot hold meta characters; but when a
string is to be used as a key sequence, there is a special convention
that provides a way to represent meta versions of <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters in a string.  If you use the &lsquo;<samp>\M-</samp>&rsquo; syntax to indicate
a meta character in a string constant, this sets the
2**7
bit of the character in the string.  If the string is used in
<code>define-key</code> or <code>lookup-key</code>, this numeric code is translated
into the equivalent meta character.  See <a href="Character-Type.html#Character-Type">Character Type</a>.
</p>
<p>Strings cannot hold characters that have the hyper, super, or alt
modifiers.
