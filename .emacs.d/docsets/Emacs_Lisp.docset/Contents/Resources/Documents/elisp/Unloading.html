<!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
  You can discard the functions and variables loaded by a library to
reclaim memory for other Lisp objects.  To do this, use the function
<code>unload-feature</code>:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/unload%2Dfeature"></a><a name="DASH-2232"></a>— Command: <b>unload-feature</b><var> feature &amp;optional force<a name="index-unload_002dfeature-924"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command unloads the library that provided feature <var>feature</var>. 
It undefines all functions, macros, and variables defined in that
library with <code>defun</code>, <code>defalias</code>, <code>defsubst</code>,
<code>defmacro</code>, <code>defconst</code>, <code>defvar</code>, and <code>defcustom</code>. 
It then restores any autoloads formerly associated with those symbols. 
(Loading saves these in the <code>autoload</code> property of the symbol.)

        </p><p>Before restoring the previous definitions, <code>unload-feature</code> runs
<code>remove-hook</code> to remove functions in the library from certain
hooks.  These hooks include variables whose names end in ‘<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>’
(or the deprecated suffix ‘<samp><span class="samp">-hooks</span></samp>’), plus those listed in
<code>unload-feature-special-hooks</code>, as well as
<code>auto-mode-alist</code>.  This is to prevent Emacs from ceasing to
function because important hooks refer to functions that are no longer
defined.

        </p><p>Standard unloading activities also undoes ELP profiling of functions
in that library, unprovides any features provided by the library, and
cancels timers held in variables defined by the library.

        </p><p><a name="index-g_t_0040var_007bfeature_007d_002dunload_002dfunction-925"></a>If these measures are not sufficient to prevent malfunction, a library
can define an explicit unloader named <var>feature</var><code>-unload-function</code>. 
If that symbol is defined as a function, <code>unload-feature</code> calls
it with no arguments before doing anything else.  It can do whatever
is appropriate to unload the library.  If it returns <code>nil</code>,
<code>unload-feature</code> proceeds to take the normal unload actions. 
Otherwise it considers the job to be done.

        </p><p>Ordinarily, <code>unload-feature</code> refuses to unload a library on which
other loaded libraries depend.  (A library <var>a</var> depends on library
<var>b</var> if <var>a</var> contains a <code>require</code> for <var>b</var>.)  If the
optional argument <var>force</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, dependencies are
ignored and you can unload any library. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The <code>unload-feature</code> function is written in Lisp; its actions are
based on the variable <code>load-history</code>.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/unload%2Dfeature%2Dspecial%2Dhooks"></a><a name="DASH-2233"></a>— Variable: <b>unload-feature-special-hooks</b><var><a name="index-unload_002dfeature_002dspecial_002dhooks-926"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable holds a list of hooks to be scanned before unloading a
library, to remove functions defined in the library. 
</p></blockquote></div>
