<h3 class="section">E.5 C Dialect</h3>

<p><a name="index-C-programming-language-4440"></a>
The C part of Emacs is portable to C89: C99-specific features such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inline</span></samp>&rsquo; are not used without a check,
typically at configuration time, and the Emacs build procedure
provides a substitute implementation if necessary.  Some C99 features,
such as declarations after statements, are too difficult to provide
substitutes for, so they are avoided entirely.

   <p>At some point in the not-too-distant future the base C dialect will
change from C89 to C99, and eventually it will no doubt change to C11.
