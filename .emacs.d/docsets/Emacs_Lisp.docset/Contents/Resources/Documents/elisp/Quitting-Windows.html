<h3 class="section">27.18 Quitting Windows</h3>

<p>When you want to get rid of a window used for displaying a buffer, you
can call <code>delete-window</code> or <code>delete-windows-on</code>
(see <a href="Deleting-Windows.html#Deleting-Windows">Deleting Windows</a>) to remove that window from its frame.  If the
buffer is shown on a separate frame, you might want to call
<code>delete-frame</code> (see <a href="Deleting-Frames.html#Deleting-Frames">Deleting Frames</a>) instead.  If, on the other
hand, a window has been reused for displaying the buffer, you might
prefer showing the buffer previously shown in that window, by calling the
function <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> (see <a href="Window-History.html#Window-History">Window History</a>).
Finally, you might want to either bury (see <a href="Buffer-List.html#Buffer-List">Buffer List</a>) or kill
(see <a href="Killing-Buffers.html#Killing-Buffers">Killing Buffers</a>) the window’s buffer.
</p>
<p>The following command uses information on how the window for
displaying the buffer was obtained in the first place, thus attempting
to automate the above decisions for you.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/quit%2Dwindow"></a><a name="index-quit_002dwindow"></a>Command: <strong>quit-window</strong> <em>&amp;optional kill window</em></dt>
<dd><p>This command quits <var>window</var> and buries its buffer.  The argument
<var>window</var> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
With prefix argument <var>kill</var> non-<code>nil</code>, it kills the buffer
instead of burying it.  It calls the function <code>quit-restore-window</code>
described next to deal with the window and its buffer.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/quit%2Drestore%2Dwindow"></a><a name="index-quit_002drestore_002dwindow"></a>Function: <strong>quit-restore-window</strong> <em>&amp;optional window bury-or-kill</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function tries to restore the state of <var>window</var> that existed
before its buffer was displayed in it.  The optional argument
<var>window</var> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
</p>
<p>If <var>window</var> was created specially for displaying its buffer, this
function deletes <var>window</var> provided its frame contains at least one
other live window.  If <var>window</var> is the only window on its frame and
there are other frames on the frame’s terminal, the value of the
optional argument <var>bury-or-kill</var> determines how to proceed with the
window.  If <var>bury-or-kill</var> equals <code>kill</code>, the frame is deleted
unconditionally.  Otherwise, the fate of the frame is determined by
calling <code>frame-auto-hide-function</code> (see below) with that frame as
sole argument.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, this function tries to redisplay the buffer previously shown
in <var>window</var>.  It also tries to restore the window start
(see <a href="Window-Start-and-End.html#Window-Start-and-End">Window Start and End</a>) and point (see <a href="Window-Point.html#Window-Point">Window Point</a>)
positions of the previously shown buffer.  If, in addition,
<var>window</var>’s buffer was temporarily resized, this function will also
try to restore the original height of <var>window</var>.
</p>
<p>The cases described so far require that the buffer shown in <var>window</var>
is still the buffer displayed by the last buffer display function for
this window.  If another buffer has been shown in the meantime, or the
buffer previously shown no longer exists, this function calls
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> (see <a href="Window-History.html#Window-History">Window History</a>) to show some other
buffer instead.
</p>
<p>The optional argument <var>bury-or-kill</var> specifies how to deal with
<var>window</var>’s buffer.  The following values are handled:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>nil</code></dt>
<dd><p>This means to not deal with the buffer in any particular way.  As a
consequence, if <var>window</var> is not deleted, invoking
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> will usually show the buffer again.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>append</code></dt>
<dd><p>This means that if <var>window</var> is not deleted, its buffer is moved to
the end of <var>window</var>’s list of previous buffers, so it’s less likely
that a future invocation of <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> will switch to
it.  Also, it moves the buffer to the end of the frame’s buffer list.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>bury</code></dt>
<dd><p>This means that if <var>window</var> is not deleted, its buffer is removed
from <var>window</var>’s list of previous buffers.  Also, it moves the buffer
to the end of the frame’s buffer list.  This value provides the most
reliable remedy to not have <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> switch to this
buffer again without killing the buffer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>kill</code></dt>
<dd><p>This means to kill <var>window</var>’s buffer.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p><code>quit-restore-window</code> bases its decisions on information stored in
<var>window</var>’s <code>quit-restore</code> window parameter (see <a href="Window-Parameters.html#Window-Parameters">Window Parameters</a>), and resets that parameter to <code>nil</code> after it’s done.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The following option specifies how to deal with a frame containing just
one window that should be either quit, or whose buffer should be buried.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/frame%2Dauto%2Dhide%2Dfunction"></a><a name="index-frame_002dauto_002dhide_002dfunction"></a>User Option: <strong>frame-auto-hide-function</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The function specified by this option is called to automatically hide
frames.  This function is called with one argument—a frame.
</p>
<p>The function specified here is called by <code>bury-buffer</code>
(see <a href="Buffer-List.html#Buffer-List">Buffer List</a>) when the selected window is dedicated and shows
the buffer to bury.  It is also called by <code>quit-restore-window</code>
(see above) when the frame of the window to quit has been specially
created for displaying that window’s buffer and the buffer is not
killed.
</p>
<p>The default is to call <code>iconify-frame</code> (see <a href="Visibility-of-Frames.html#Visibility-of-Frames">Visibility of Frames</a>).  Alternatively, you may specify either <code>delete-frame</code>
(see <a href="Deleting-Frames.html#Deleting-Frames">Deleting Frames</a>) to remove the frame from its display,
<code>ignore</code> to leave the frame unchanged, or any other function that
can take a frame as its sole argument.
</p>
<p>Note that the function specified by this option is called only if the
specified frame contains just one live window and there is at least one
other frame on the same terminal.
</p></dd></dl>
