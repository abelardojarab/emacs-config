<h3 class="section">38.21 Dynamically Loaded Libraries</h3>
<a name="index-dynamic-libraries"></a>

<p>A <em>dynamically loaded library</em> is a library that is loaded on
demand, when its facilities are first needed.  Emacs supports such
on-demand loading of support libraries for some of its features.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/dynamic%2Dlibrary%2Dalist"></a><a name="index-dynamic_002dlibrary_002dalist"></a>Variable: <strong>dynamic-library-alist</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is an alist of dynamic libraries and external library files
implementing them.
</p>
<p>Each element is a list of the form
<code>(<var>library</var>&nbsp;<var>files</var>…)</code><!-- /@w -->, where the <code>car</code> is
a symbol representing a supported external library, and the rest are
strings giving alternate filenames for that library.
</p>
<p>Emacs tries to load the library from the files in the order they
appear in the list; if none is found, the Emacs session won’t have
access to that library, and the features it provides will be
unavailable.
</p>
<p>Image support on some platforms uses this facility.  Here’s an example
of setting this variable for supporting images on MS-Windows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq dynamic-library-alist
      '((xpm "libxpm.dll" "xpm4.dll" "libXpm-nox4.dll")
        (png "libpng12d.dll" "libpng12.dll" "libpng.dll"
             "libpng13d.dll" "libpng13.dll")
        (jpeg "jpeg62.dll" "libjpeg.dll" "jpeg-62.dll"
              "jpeg.dll")
        (tiff "libtiff3.dll" "libtiff.dll")
        (gif "giflib4.dll" "libungif4.dll" "libungif.dll")
        (svg "librsvg-2-2.dll")
        (gdk-pixbuf "libgdk_pixbuf-2.0-0.dll")
        (glib "libglib-2.0-0.dll")
        (gobject "libgobject-2.0-0.dll")))
</pre></div>

<p>Note that image types <code>pbm</code> and <code>xbm</code> do not need entries in
this variable because they do not depend on external libraries and are
always available in Emacs.
</p>
<p>Also note that this variable is not meant to be a generic facility for
accessing external libraries; only those already known by Emacs can
be loaded through it.
</p>
<p>This variable is ignored if the given <var>library</var> is statically
linked into Emacs.
</p></dd></dl>
