<h3 class="section">12.15 Determining whether a Function is Safe to Call</h3>

<p><a name="index-function-safety-805"></a><a name="index-safety-of-functions-806"></a>
Some major modes, such as SES, call functions that are stored in user
files.  (see <a href="../ses/index.html#Top">Top</a>, for more information on SES.)  User
files sometimes have poor pedigrees—you can get a spreadsheet from
someone you've just met, or you can get one through email from someone
you've never met.  So it is risky to call a function whose source code
is stored in a user file until you have determined that it is safe.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/unsafep"></a><a name="DASH-980"></a>— Function: <b>unsafep</b><var> form &amp;optional unsafep-vars<a name="index-unsafep-807"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Returns <code>nil</code> if <var>form</var> is a <dfn>safe</dfn> Lisp expression, or
returns a list that describes why it might be unsafe.  The argument
<var>unsafep-vars</var> is a list of symbols known to have temporary
bindings at this point; it is mainly used for internal recursive
calls.  The current buffer is an implicit argument, which provides a
list of buffer-local bindings. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Being quick and simple, <code>unsafep</code> does a very light analysis and
rejects many Lisp expressions that are actually safe.  There are no
known cases where <code>unsafep</code> returns <code>nil</code> for an unsafe
expression.  However, a “safe” Lisp expression can return a string
with a <code>display</code> property, containing an associated Lisp
expression to be executed after the string is inserted into a buffer. 
This associated expression can be a virus.  In order to be safe, you
must delete properties from all strings calculated by user code before
inserting them into buffers.
