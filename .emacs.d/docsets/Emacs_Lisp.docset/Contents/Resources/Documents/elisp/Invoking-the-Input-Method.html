<h4 class="subsection">20.8.4 Invoking the Input Method</h4>

<p>The event-reading functions invoke the current input method, if any
(see <a href="Input-Methods.html#Input-Methods">Input Methods</a>).  If the value of <code>input-method-function</code>
is non-<code>nil</code>, it should be a function; when <code>read-event</code> reads
a printing character (including &lt;SPC&gt;) with no modifier bits, it
calls that function, passing the character as an argument.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/input%2Dmethod%2Dfunction"></a><a name="DASH-1147"></a>â€” Variable: <b>input-method-function</b><var><a name="index-input_002dmethod_002dfunction-1442"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this is non-<code>nil</code>, its value specifies the current input method
function.

        </p><p><strong>Warning:</strong> don't bind this variable with <code>let</code>.  It is often
buffer-local, and if you bind it around reading input (which is exactly
when you <em>would</em> bind it), switching buffers asynchronously while
Emacs is waiting will cause the value to be restored in the wrong
buffer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The input method function should return a list of events which should
be used as input.  (If the list is <code>nil</code>, that means there is no
input, so <code>read-event</code> waits for another event.)  These events are
processed before the events in <code>unread-command-events</code>
(see <a href="Event-Input-Misc.html#Event-Input-Misc">Event Input Misc</a>).  Events
returned by the input method function are not passed to the input method
function again, even if they are printing characters with no modifier
bits.

   </p><p>If the input method function calls <code>read-event</code> or
<code>read-key-sequence</code>, it should bind <code>input-method-function</code> to
<code>nil</code> first, to prevent recursion.

   </p><p>The input method function is not called when reading the second and
subsequent events of a key sequence.  Thus, these characters are not
subject to input method processing.  The input method function should
test the values of <code>overriding-local-map</code> and
<code>overriding-terminal-local-map</code>; if either of these variables is
non-<code>nil</code>, the input method should put its argument into a list and
return that list with no further processing.
