<h3 class="section">30.7 The Mark</h3>

<p><a name="index-mark_002c-the-2849"></a><!-- @cindex the mark? -->

   </p><p>Each buffer has a special marker, which is designated <dfn>the
mark</dfn>.  When a buffer is newly created, this marker exists but does
not point anywhere; this means that the mark “doesn't exist” in that
buffer yet.  Subsequent commands can set the mark.

   </p><p>The mark specifies a position to bound a range of text for many
commands, such as <code>kill-region</code> and <code>indent-rigidly</code>.  These
commands typically act on the text between point and the mark, which
is called the <dfn>region</dfn>.  If you are writing a command that
operates on the region, don't examine the mark directly; instead, use
<code>interactive</code> with the ‘<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>’ specification.  This provides the
values of point and the mark as arguments to the command in an
interactive call, but permits other Lisp programs to specify arguments
explicitly.  See <a href="Interactive-Codes.html#Interactive-Codes">Interactive Codes</a>.

   </p><p>Some commands set the mark as a side-effect.  Commands should do
this only if it has a potential use to the user, and never for their
own internal purposes.  For example, the <code>replace-regexp</code> command
sets the mark to the value of point before doing any replacements,
because this enables the user to move back there conveniently after
the replace is finished.

   </p><p>Once the mark “exists” in a buffer, it normally never ceases to
exist.  However, it may become <dfn>inactive</dfn>, if Transient Mark mode
is enabled.  The buffer-local variable <code>mark-active</code>, if
non-<code>nil</code>, means that the mark is active.  A command can call the
function <code>deactivate-mark</code> to deactivate the mark directly, or it
can request deactivation of the mark upon return to the editor command
loop by setting the variable <code>deactivate-mark</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value.

   </p><p>If Transient Mark mode is enabled, certain editing commands that
normally apply to text near point, apply instead to the region when
the mark is active.  This is the main motivation for using Transient
Mark mode.  (Another is that this enables highlighting of the region
when the mark is active.  See <a href="Display.html#Display">Display</a>.)

   </p><p><a name="index-mark-ring-2850"></a>  In addition to the mark, each buffer has a <dfn>mark ring</dfn> which is a
list of markers containing previous values of the mark.  When editing
commands change the mark, they should normally save the old value of the
mark on the mark ring.  The variable <code>mark-ring-max</code> specifies the
maximum number of entries in the mark ring; once the list becomes this
long, adding a new element deletes the last element.

   </p><p>There is also a separate global mark ring, but that is used only in a
few particular user-level commands, and is not relevant to Lisp
programming.  So we do not describe it here.

        </p><p>If Transient Mark mode is enabled, and <code>mark-even-if-inactive</code> is
<code>nil</code>, <code>mark</code> signals an error if the mark is inactive. 
However, if <var>force</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <code>mark</code> disregards
inactivity of the mark, and returns the mark position (or <code>nil</code>)
anyway.

<blockquote><p>This function returns the marker that represents the current buffer's
mark.  It is not a copy, it is the marker used internally.  Therefore,
changing this marker's position will directly affect the buffer's
mark.  Don't do that unless that is the effect you want.

     </p><pre class="example">          (setq m (mark-marker))
               ⇒ #&lt;marker at 3420 in markers.texi&gt;
          (set-marker m 100)

</pre>
        <p>Like any marker, this marker can be set to point at any buffer you
like.  If you make it point at any buffer other than the one of which
it is the mark, it will yield perfectly consistent, but rather odd,
results.  We recommend that you not do it!

<blockquote><p>This function sets the mark to <var>position</var>, and activates the mark. 
The old value of the mark is <em>not</em> pushed onto the mark ring.

        </p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> Use this function only if you want the user to
see that the mark has moved, and you want the previous mark position to
be lost.  Normally, when a new mark is set, the old one should go on the
<code>mark-ring</code>.  For this reason, most applications should use
<code>push-mark</code> and <code>pop-mark</code>, not <code>set-mark</code>.

        </p><p>Novice Emacs Lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong
purposes.  The mark saves a location for the user's convenience.  An
editing command should not alter the mark unless altering the mark is
part of the user-level functionality of the command.  (And, in that
case, this effect should be documented.)  To remember a location for
internal use in the Lisp program, store it in a Lisp variable.  For
example:

     </p><pre class="example">          (let ((beg (point)))
            (forward-line 1)
            (delete-region beg (point))).

<blockquote><p>This variable, if non-<code>nil</code>, enables Transient Mark mode.  In
Transient Mark mode, every buffer-modifying primitive sets
<code>deactivate-mark</code>.  As a consequence, most commands that modify
the buffer also deactivate the mark.

        </p><p>When Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active, many
commands that normally apply to the text near point instead apply to
the region.  Such commands should use the function <code>use-region-p</code>
to test whether they should operate on the region.  See <a href="The-Region.html#The-Region">The Region</a>.

        </p><p>Lisp programs can set <code>transient-mark-mode</code> to non-<code>nil</code>,
non-<code>t</code> values to enable Transient Mark mode temporarily.  If the
value is <code>lambda</code>, Transient Mark mode is automatically turned
off after any action, such as buffer modification, that would normally
deactivate the mark.  If the value is <code>(only&nbsp;.&nbsp;</code><var>oldval</var><code>)</code><!-- /@w -->,
then <code>transient-mark-mode</code> is set to the value <var>oldval</var> after
any subsequent command that moves point and is not shift-translated
(see <a href="Key-Sequence-Input.html#Key-Sequence-Input">shift-translation</a>), or after any other
action that would normally deactivate the mark.
