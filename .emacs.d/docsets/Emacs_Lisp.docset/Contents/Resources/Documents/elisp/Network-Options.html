<h4 class="subsection">36.17.2 Network Options</h4>

<p>The following network options can be specified when you create a
network process.  Except for <code>:reuseaddr</code>, you can also set or
modify these options later, using <code>set-network-process-option</code>.

   </p><p>For a server process, the options specified with
<code>make-network-process</code> are not inherited by the client
connections, so you will need to set the necessary options for each
child connection as it is created.

     </p><dl>
<dt>:bindtodevice <var>device-name</var></dt><dd>If <var>device-name</var> is a non-empty string identifying a network
interface name (see <code>network-interface-list</code>), only handle
packets received on that interface.  If <var>device-name</var> is <code>nil</code>
(the default), handle packets received on any interface.

     <p>Using this option may require special privileges on some systems.

     <br></p></dd><dt>:broadcast <var>broadcast-flag</var></dt><dd>If <var>broadcast-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code> for a datagram process, the
process will receive datagram packet sent to a broadcast address, and
be able to send packets to a broadcast address.  This is ignored for a stream
connection.

     <br></dd><dt>:dontroute <var>dontroute-flag</var></dt><dd>If <var>dontroute-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the process can only send
to hosts on the same network as the local host.

     <br></dd><dt>:keepalive <var>keepalive-flag</var></dt><dd>If <var>keepalive-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code> for a stream connection,
enable exchange of low-level keep-alive messages.

     <br></dd><dt>:linger <var>linger-arg</var></dt><dd>If <var>linger-arg</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, wait for successful
transmission of all queued packets on the connection before it is
deleted (see <code>delete-process</code>).  If <var>linger-arg</var> is an
integer, it specifies the maximum time in seconds to wait for queued
packets to be sent before closing the connection.  The default is
<code>nil</code>, which means to discard unsent queued packets when the
process is deleted.

     <!-- FIXME  Where out-of-band data is ...? -->
     <br></dd><dt>:oobinline <var>oobinline-flag</var></dt><dd>If <var>oobinline-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code> for a stream connection,
receive out-of-band data in the normal data stream.  Otherwise, ignore
out-of-band data.

     <br></dd><dt>:priority <var>priority</var></dt><dd>Set the priority for packets sent on this connection to the integer
<var>priority</var>.  The interpretation of this number is protocol
specific; such as setting the TOS (type of service) field on IP
packets sent on this connection.  It may also have system dependent
effects, such as selecting a specific output queue on the network
interface.

     <br></dd><dt>:reuseaddr <var>reuseaddr-flag</var></dt><dd>If <var>reuseaddr-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code> (the default) for a stream
server process, allow this server to reuse a specific port number (see
<code>:service</code>), unless another process on this host is already
listening on that port.  If <var>reuseaddr-flag</var> is <code>nil</code>, there
may be a period of time after the last use of that port (by any
process on the host) where it is not possible to make a new server on
that port.
