<h5 class="subsubsection">22.7.1.8 Sample Indentation Rules</h5>

<p>Here is an example of an indentation function:

<pre class="example">     (defun sample-smie-rules (kind token)
       (pcase (cons kind token)
         (`(:elem . basic) sample-indent-basic)
         (`(,_ . ",") (smie-rule-separator kind))
         (`(:after . ":=") sample-indent-basic)
         (`(:before . ,(or `"begin" `"(" `"{")))
          (if (smie-rule-hanging-p) (smie-rule-parent)))
         (`(:before . "if")
          (and (not (smie-rule-bolp)) (smie-rule-prev-p "else")
               (smie-rule-parent)))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">A few things to note:

     <ul>
<li>The first case indicates the basic indentation increment to use. 
If <code>sample-indent-basic</code> is <code>nil</code>, then SMIE uses the global
setting <code>smie-indent-basic</code>.  The major mode could have set
<code>smie-indent-basic</code> buffer-locally instead, but that
is discouraged.

     <li>The rule for the token <code>","</code> make SMIE try to be more clever when
the comma separator is placed at the beginning of lines.  It tries to
outdent the separator so as to align the code after the comma; for
example:

     <pre class="example">          x = longfunctionname (
                  arg1
                , arg2
              );
</pre>
     <li>The rule for indentation after <code>":="</code> exists because otherwise
SMIE would treat <code>":="</code> as an infix operator and would align the
right argument with the left one.

     <li>The rule for indentation before <code>"begin"</code> is an example of the use
of virtual indentation:  This rule is used only when <code>"begin"</code> is
hanging, which can happen only when <code>"begin"</code> is not at the
beginning of a line.  So this is not used when indenting
<code>"begin"</code> itself but only when indenting something relative to this
<code>"begin"</code>.  Concretely, this rule changes the indentation from:

     <pre class="example">              if x &gt; 0 then begin
                      dosomething(x);
                  end
</pre>
     <p>to
     <pre class="example">              if x &gt; 0 then begin
                  dosomething(x);
              end
</pre>
     <li>The rule for indentation before <code>"if"</code> is similar to the one for
<code>"begin"</code>, but where the purpose is to treat <code>"else if"</code>
as a single unit, so as to align a sequence of tests rather than indent
each test further to the right.  This function does this only in the
case where the <code>"if"</code> is not placed on a separate line, hence the
<code>smie-rule-bolp</code> test.

     <p>If we know that the <code>"else"</code> is always aligned with its <code>"if"</code>
and is always at the beginning of a line, we can use a more efficient
rule:
     <pre class="example">          ((equal token "if")
           (and (not (smie-rule-bolp))
                (smie-rule-prev-p "else")
                (save-excursion
                  (sample-smie-backward-token)
                  (cons 'column (current-column)))))
</pre>
     <p>The advantage of this formulation is that it reuses the indentation of
the previous <code>"else"</code>, rather than going all the way back to the
first <code>"if"</code> of the sequence. 
</ul>
