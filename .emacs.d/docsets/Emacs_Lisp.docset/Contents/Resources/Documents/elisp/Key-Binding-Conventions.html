<h3 class="section">D.2 Key Binding Conventions</h3>
<a name="index-key-binding_002c-conventions-for"></a>

<ul>
<li> <a name="index-mouse_002d2"></a>
<a name="index-references_002c-following"></a>
Many special major modes, like Dired, Info, Compilation, and Occur,
are designed to handle read-only text that contains <em>hyper-links</em>.
Such a major mode should redefine <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> and <tt class="key">RET</tt> to
follow the links.  It should also set up a <code>follow-link</code>
condition, so that the link obeys <code>mouse-1-click-follows-link</code>.
See <a href="Clickable-Text.html#Clickable-Text">Clickable Text</a>.  See <a href="Buttons.html#Buttons">Buttons</a>, for an easy method of
implementing such clickable links.

</li><li> <a name="index-reserved-keys"></a>
<a name="index-keys_002c-reserved"></a>
Don&rsquo;t define <kbd>C-c <var>letter</var></kbd> as a key in Lisp programs.
Sequences consisting of <kbd>C-c</kbd> and a letter (either upper or lower
case) are reserved for users; they are the <strong>only</strong> sequences
reserved for users, so do not block them.

<p>Changing all the Emacs major modes to respect this convention was a
lot of work; abandoning this convention would make that work go to
waste, and inconvenience users.  Please comply with it.
</p>
</li><li> Function keys <tt class="key">F5</tt> through <tt class="key">F9</tt> without modifier keys are
also reserved for users to define.

</li><li> Sequences consisting of <kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by a control character or a
digit are reserved for major modes.

</li><li> Sequences consisting of <kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by <kbd>{</kbd>, <kbd>}</kbd>,
<kbd>&lt;</kbd>, <kbd>&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>:</kbd> or <kbd>;</kbd> are also reserved for major modes.

</li><li> Sequences consisting of <kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by any other
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> punctuation or symbol character are allocated for
minor modes.  Using them in a major mode is not absolutely prohibited,
but if you do that, the major mode binding may be shadowed from time
to time by minor modes.

</li><li> Don&rsquo;t bind <kbd>C-h</kbd> following any prefix character (including
<kbd>C-c</kbd>).  If you don&rsquo;t bind <kbd>C-h</kbd>, it is automatically
available as a help character for listing the subcommands of the
prefix character.

</li><li> Don&rsquo;t bind a key sequence ending in <tt class="key">ESC</tt> except following another
<tt class="key">ESC</tt>.  (That is, it is OK to bind a sequence ending in
<kbd><span class="key">ESC</span> <span class="key">ESC</span></kbd>.)

<p>The reason for this rule is that a non-prefix binding for <tt class="key">ESC</tt> in
any context prevents recognition of escape sequences as function keys in
that context.
</p>
</li><li> Similarly, don&rsquo;t bind a key sequence ending in <tt class="key">C-g</tt>, since that
is commonly used to cancel a key sequence.

</li><li> Anything that acts like a temporary mode or state that the user can
enter and leave should define <kbd><span class="key">ESC</span> <span class="key">ESC</span></kbd> or
<kbd><span class="key">ESC</span> <span class="key">ESC</span> <span class="key">ESC</span></kbd> as a way to escape.

<p>For a state that accepts ordinary Emacs commands, or more generally any
kind of state in which <tt class="key">ESC</tt> followed by a function key or arrow key
is potentially meaningful, then you must not define <kbd><span class="key">ESC</span>
<span class="key">ESC</span></kbd>, since that would preclude recognizing an escape sequence
after <tt class="key">ESC</tt>.  In these states, you should define <kbd><span class="key">ESC</span>
<span class="key">ESC</span> <span class="key">ESC</span></kbd> as the way to escape.  Otherwise, define
<kbd><span class="key">ESC</span> <span class="key">ESC</span></kbd> instead.
</p></li></ul>
