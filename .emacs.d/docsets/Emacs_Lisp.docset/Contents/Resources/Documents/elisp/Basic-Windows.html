<h3 class="section">27.1 Basic Concepts of Emacs Windows</h3>
<a name="index-window"></a>

<p>A <em>window</em> is an area of the screen that is used to display a buffer
(see <a href="Buffers.html#Buffers">Buffers</a>).  In Emacs Lisp, windows are represented by a special
Lisp object type.
</p>
<a name="index-multiple-windows"></a>
<p>Windows are grouped into frames (see <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>).  Each frame
contains at least one window; the user can subdivide it into multiple,
non-overlapping windows to view several buffers at once.  Lisp
programs can use multiple windows for a variety of purposes.  In
Rmail, for example, you can view a summary of message titles in one
window, and the contents of the selected message in another window.
</p>
<a name="index-terminal-screen"></a>
<a name="index-screen-of-terminal"></a>
<p>Emacs uses the word “window” with a different meaning than in
graphical desktop environments and window systems, such as the X
Window System.  When Emacs is run on X, each of its graphical X
windows is an Emacs frame (containing one or more Emacs windows).
When Emacs is run on a text terminal, the frame fills the entire
terminal screen.
</p>
<a name="index-tiled-windows"></a>
<p>Unlike X windows, Emacs windows are <em>tiled</em>; they never overlap
within the area of the frame.  When a window is created, resized, or
deleted, the change in window space is taken from or given to the
adjacent windows, so that the total area of the frame is unchanged.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/windowp"></a><a name="index-windowp"></a>Function: <strong>windowp</strong> <em>object</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a window (whether or
not it displays a buffer).  Otherwise, it returns <code>nil</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="index-live-windows"></a>
<p>A <em>live window</em> is one that is actually displaying a buffer in a
frame.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/window%2Dlive%2Dp"></a><a name="index-window_002dlive_002dp"></a>Function: <strong>window-live-p</strong> <em>object</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a live window and
<code>nil</code> otherwise.  A live window is one that displays a buffer.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="index-internal-windows"></a>
<p>The windows in each frame are organized into a <em>window tree</em>.
See <a href="Windows-and-Frames.html#Windows-and-Frames">Windows and Frames</a>.  The leaf nodes of each window tree are live
windows—the ones actually displaying buffers.  The internal nodes of
the window tree are <em>internal windows</em>, which are not live.
</p>
<a name="index-valid-windows"></a>
<p>A <em>valid window</em> is one that is either live or internal.  A valid
window can be <em>deleted</em>, i.e., removed from its frame
(see <a href="Deleting-Windows.html#Deleting-Windows">Deleting Windows</a>); then it is no longer valid, but the Lisp
object representing it might be still referenced from other Lisp
objects.  A deleted window may be made valid again by restoring a saved
window configuration (see <a href="Window-Configurations.html#Window-Configurations">Window Configurations</a>).
</p>
<p>You can distinguish valid windows from deleted windows with
<code>window-valid-p</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/window%2Dvalid%2Dp"></a><a name="index-window_002dvalid_002dp"></a>Function: <strong>window-valid-p</strong> <em>object</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a live window, or an
internal window in a window tree.  Otherwise, it returns <code>nil</code>,
including for the case where <var>object</var> is a deleted window.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="index-selected-window"></a>
<a name="index-window-selected-within-a-frame"></a>
<p>In each frame, at any time, exactly one Emacs window is designated
as <em>selected within the frame</em>.  For the selected frame, that
window is called the <em>selected window</em>—the one in which most
editing takes place, and in which the cursor for selected windows
appears (see <a href="Cursor-Parameters.html#Cursor-Parameters">Cursor Parameters</a>).  The selected window’s buffer is
usually also the current buffer, except when <code>set-buffer</code> has
been used (see <a href="Current-Buffer.html#Current-Buffer">Current Buffer</a>).  As for non-selected frames, the
window selected within the frame becomes the selected window if the
frame is ever selected.  See <a href="Selecting-Windows.html#Selecting-Windows">Selecting Windows</a>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/selected%2Dwindow"></a><a name="index-selected_002dwindow"></a>Function: <strong>selected-window</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the selected window (which is always a live
window).
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="Window-Group"></a><p>Sometimes several windows collectively and
cooperatively display a buffer, for example, under the management of
Follow Mode (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Follow-Mode.html#Follow-Mode">(emacs)Follow Mode</a>), where the windows together
display a bigger portion of the buffer than one window could alone.
It is often useful to consider such a <em>window group</em> as a single
entity.  Several functions such as <code>window-group-start</code>
(see <a href="Window-Start-and-End.html#Window-Start-and-End">Window Start and End</a>) allow you to do this by supplying, as
an argument, one of the windows as a stand in for the whole group.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/selected%2Dwindow%2Dgroup"></a><a name="index-selected_002dwindow_002dgroup"></a>Function: <strong>selected-window-group</strong></dt>
<dd><a name="index-selected_002dwindow_002dgroup_002dfunction"></a>
<p>When the selected window is a member of a group of windows, this
function returns a list of the windows in the group, ordered such that
the first window in the list is displaying the earliest part of the
buffer, and so on.  Otherwise the function returns a list containing
just the selected window.
</p>
<p>The selected window is considered part of a group when the buffer
local variable <code>selected-window-group-function</code> is set to a
function.  In this case, <code>selected-window-group</code> calls it with no
arguments and returns its result (which should be the list of windows
in the group).
