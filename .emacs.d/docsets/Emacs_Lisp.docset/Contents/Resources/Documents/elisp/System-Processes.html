<h3 class="section">36.12 Accessing Other Processes</h3>

<p><a name="index-system-processes-3673"></a>
  In addition to accessing and manipulating processes that are
subprocesses of the current Emacs session, Emacs Lisp programs can
also access other processes running on the same machine.  We call
these <dfn>system processes</dfn>, to distinguish them from Emacs
subprocesses.

   </p><p>Emacs provides several primitives for accessing system processes. 
Not all platforms support these primitives; on those which don't,
these primitives return <code>nil</code>.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/list%2Dsystem%2Dprocesses"></a><a name="DASH-2062"></a>— Function: <b>list-system-processes</b><var><a name="index-list_002dsystem_002dprocesses-3674"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a list of all the processes running on the
system.  Each process is identified by its <acronym>PID</acronym>, a numerical
process ID that is assigned by the OS and distinguishes the process
from all the other processes running on the same machine at the same
time. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/process%2Dattributes"></a><a name="DASH-2063"></a>— Function: <b>process-attributes</b><var> pid<a name="index-process_002dattributes-3675"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns an alist of attributes for the process specified
by its process ID <var>pid</var>.  Each association in the alist is of the
form <code>(</code><var>key</var><code> . </code><var>value</var><code>)</code>, where <var>key</var> designates the
attribute and <var>value</var> is the value of that attribute.  The various
attribute <var>key</var>s that this function can return are listed below. 
Not all platforms support all of these attributes; if an attribute is
not supported, its association will not appear in the returned alist. 
Values that are numbers can be either integer or floating point,
depending on the magnitude of the value.

          </p><dl>
<dt><code>euid</code></dt><dd>The effective user ID of the user who invoked the process.  The
corresponding <var>value</var> is a number.  If the process was invoked by
the same user who runs the current Emacs session, the value is
identical to what <code>user-uid</code> returns (see <a href="User-Identification.html#User-Identification">User Identification</a>).

          <br></dd><dt><code>user</code></dt><dd>User name corresponding to the process's effective user ID, a string.

          <br></dd><dt><code>egid</code></dt><dd>The group ID of the effective user ID, a number.

          <br></dd><dt><code>group</code></dt><dd>Group name corresponding to the effective user's group ID, a string.

          <br></dd><dt><code>comm</code></dt><dd>The name of the command that runs in the process.  This is a string
that usually specifies the name of the executable file of the process,
without the leading directories.  However, some special system
processes can report strings that do not correspond to an executable
file of a program.

          <br></dd><dt><code>state</code></dt><dd>The state code of the process.  This is a short string that encodes
the scheduling state of the process.  Here's a list of the most
frequently seen codes:

               <dl>
<dt><code>"D"</code></dt><dd>uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O)
<br></dd><dt><code>"R"</code></dt><dd>running
<br></dd><dt><code>"S"</code></dt><dd>interruptible sleep (waiting for some event)
<br></dd><dt><code>"T"</code></dt><dd>stopped, e.g., by a job control signal
<br></dd><dt><code>"Z"</code></dt><dd>“zombie”: a process that terminated, but was not reaped by its parent
</dd></dl>

          <p class="noindent">For the full list of the possible states, see the manual page of the
<samp><span class="command">ps</span></samp> command.

          <br></p></dd><dt><code>ppid</code></dt><dd>The process ID of the parent process, a number.

          <br></dd><dt><code>pgrp</code></dt><dd>The process group ID of the process, a number.

          <br></dd><dt><code>sess</code></dt><dd>The session ID of the process.  This is a number that is the process
ID of the process's <dfn>session leader</dfn>.

          <br></dd><dt><code>ttname</code></dt><dd>A string that is the name of the process's controlling terminal.  On
Unix and GNU systems, this is normally the file name of the
corresponding terminal device, such as <samp><span class="file">/dev/pts65</span></samp>.

          <br></dd><dt><code>tpgid</code></dt><dd>The numerical process group ID of the foreground process group that
uses the process's terminal.

          <br></dd><dt><code>minflt</code></dt><dd>The number of minor page faults caused by the process since its
beginning.  (Minor page faults are those that don't involve reading
from disk.)

          <br></dd><dt><code>majflt</code></dt><dd>The number of major page faults caused by the process since its
beginning.  (Major page faults require a disk to be read, and are thus
more expensive than minor page faults.)

          <br></dd><dt><code>cminflt</code></dt><dt><code>cmajflt</code></dt><dd>Like <code>minflt</code> and <code>majflt</code>, but include the number of page
faults for all the child processes of the given process.

          <br></dd><dt><code>utime</code></dt><dd>Time spent by the process in the user context, for running the
application's code.  The corresponding <var>value</var> is in the
<code>(</code><var>high</var><code>&nbsp;</code><var>low</var><code>&nbsp;</code><var>microsec</var><code>&nbsp;</code><var>picosec</var><code>)</code><!-- /@w --> format, the same
format used by functions <code>current-time</code> (see <a href="Time-of-Day.html#Time-of-Day">current-time</a>) and <code>file-attributes</code> (see <a href="File-Attributes.html#File-Attributes">File Attributes</a>).

          <br></dd><dt><code>stime</code></dt><dd>Time spent by the process in the system (kernel) context, for
processing system calls.  The corresponding <var>value</var> is in the same
format as for <code>utime</code>.

          <br></dd><dt><code>time</code></dt><dd>The sum of <code>utime</code> and <code>stime</code>.  The corresponding
<var>value</var> is in the same format as for <code>utime</code>.

          <br></dd><dt><code>cutime</code></dt><dt><code>cstime</code></dt><dt><code>ctime</code></dt><dd>Like <code>utime</code>, <code>stime</code>, and <code>time</code>, but include the
times of all the child processes of the given process.

          <br></dd><dt><code>pri</code></dt><dd>The numerical priority of the process.

          <br></dd><dt><code>nice</code></dt><dd>The <dfn>nice value</dfn> of the process, a number.  (Processes with smaller
nice values get scheduled more favorably.)

          <br></dd><dt><code>thcount</code></dt><dd>The number of threads in the process.

          <br></dd><dt><code>start</code></dt><dd>The time when the process was started, in the same
<code>(</code><var>high</var> <var>low</var> <var>microsec</var> <var>picosec</var><code>)</code> format used by
<code>file-attributes</code> and <code>current-time</code>.

          <br></dd><dt><code>etime</code></dt><dd>The time elapsed since the process started, in the format <code>(</code><var>high</var>
<var>low</var> <var>microsec</var> <var>picosec</var><code>)</code>.

          <br></dd><dt><code>vsize</code></dt><dd>The virtual memory size of the process, measured in kilobytes.

          <br></dd><dt><code>rss</code></dt><dd>The size of the process's <dfn>resident set</dfn>, the number of kilobytes
occupied by the process in the machine's physical memory.

          <br></dd><dt><code>pcpu</code></dt><dd>The percentage of the CPU time used by the process since it started. 
The corresponding <var>value</var> is a floating-point number between 0 and
100.

          <br></dd><dt><code>pmem</code></dt><dd>The percentage of the total physical memory installed on the machine
used by the process's resident set.  The value is a floating-point
number between 0 and 100.

          <br></dd><dt><code>args</code></dt><dd>The command-line with which the process was invoked.  This is a string
in which individual command-line arguments are separated by blanks;
whitespace characters that are embedded in the arguments are quoted as
appropriate for the system's shell: escaped by backslash characters on
GNU and Unix, and enclosed in double quote characters on Windows. 
Thus, this command-line string can be directly used in primitives such
as <code>shell-command</code>.
