<h3 class="section">E.1 Building Emacs</h3>

<p><a name="index-building-Emacs-4397"></a><a name="index-temacs-4398"></a>
  This section explains the steps involved in building the Emacs
executable.  You don't have to know this material to build and install
Emacs, since the makefiles do all these things automatically.  This
information is pertinent to Emacs developers.

   </p><p>Compilation of the C source files in the <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp> directory
produces an executable file called <samp><span class="file">temacs</span></samp>, also called a
<dfn>bare impure Emacs</dfn>.  It contains the Emacs Lisp interpreter and
I/O routines, but not the editing commands.

   </p><p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bloadup_002eel_007d-4399"></a>  The command <samp><span class="command">temacs&nbsp;-l&nbsp;loadup</span></samp><!-- /@w --> would run <samp><span class="file">temacs</span></samp>
and direct it to load <samp><span class="file">loadup.el</span></samp>.  The <code>loadup</code> library
loads additional Lisp libraries, which set up the normal Emacs editing
environment.  After this step, the Emacs executable is no longer
<dfn>bare</dfn>.

   </p><p><a name="index-dumping-Emacs-4400"></a>  Because it takes some time to load the standard Lisp files, the
<samp><span class="file">temacs</span></samp> executable usually isn't run directly by users. 
Instead, as one of the last steps of building Emacs, the command
‘<samp><span class="samp">temacs -batch -l loadup dump</span></samp>’ is run.  The special ‘<samp><span class="samp">dump</span></samp>’
argument causes <samp><span class="command">temacs</span></samp> to dump out an executable program,
called <samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp>, which has all the standard Lisp files preloaded. 
(The ‘<samp><span class="samp">-batch</span></samp>’ argument prevents <samp><span class="file">temacs</span></samp> from trying to
initialize any of its data on the terminal, so that the tables of
terminal information are empty in the dumped Emacs.)

   </p><p><a name="index-preloaded-Lisp-files-4401"></a><a name="index-preloaded_002dfile_002dlist-4402"></a>  The dumped <samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp> executable (also called a <dfn>pure</dfn> Emacs)
is the one which is installed.  The variable
<code>preloaded-file-list</code> stores a list of the Lisp files preloaded
into the dumped Emacs.  If you port Emacs to a new operating system,
and are not able to implement dumping, then Emacs must load
<samp><span class="file">loadup.el</span></samp> each time it starts.

   </p><p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bsite_002dload_002eel_007d-4403"></a>  You can specify additional files to preload by writing a library named
<samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp> that loads them.  You may need to rebuild Emacs
with an added definition

</p><pre class="example">     #define SITELOAD_PURESIZE_EXTRA <var>n</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to make <var>n</var> added bytes of pure space to hold the additional files;
see <samp><span class="file">src/puresize.h</span></samp>. 
(Try adding increments of 20000 until it is big enough.)  However, the
advantage of preloading additional files decreases as machines get
faster.  On modern machines, it is usually not advisable.

   </p><p>After <samp><span class="file">loadup.el</span></samp> reads <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp>, it finds the
documentation strings for primitive and preloaded functions (and
variables) in the file <samp><span class="file">etc/DOC</span></samp> where they are stored, by
calling <code>Snarf-documentation</code> (see <a href="Definition-of-Snarf_002ddocumentation.html#Definition-of-Snarf_002ddocumentation">Accessing Documentation</a>).

   </p><p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bsite_002dinit_002eel_007d-4404"></a><a name="index-preloading-additional-functions-and-variables-4405"></a>  You can specify other Lisp expressions to execute just before dumping
by putting them in a library named <samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp>.  This file is
executed after the documentation strings are found.

   </p><p>If you want to preload function or variable definitions, there are
three ways you can do this and make their documentation strings
accessible when you subsequently run Emacs:

     </p><ul>
<li>Arrange to scan these files when producing the <samp><span class="file">etc/DOC</span></samp> file,
and load them with <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp>.

     </li><li>Load the files with <samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp>, then copy the files into the
installation directory for Lisp files when you install Emacs.

     </li><li>Specify a <code>nil</code> value for <code>byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings</code>
as a local variable in each of these files, and load them with either
<samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp>.  (This method has the
drawback that the documentation strings take up space in Emacs all the
time.) 
</li></ul>

   <p><a name="index-change-_0040code_007bload_002dpath_007d-at-configure-time-4406"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040option_007b_002d_002denable_002dlocallisppath_007d-option-to-_0040command_007bconfigure_007d-4407"></a>  It is not advisable to put anything in <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp> that would alter any of the features that users
expect in an ordinary unmodified Emacs.  If you feel you must override
normal features for your site, do it with <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp>, so that
users can override your changes if they wish.  See <a href="Startup-Summary.html#Startup-Summary">Startup Summary</a>. 
Note that if either <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp> changes
<code>load-path</code>, the changes will be lost after dumping. 
See <a href="Library-Search.html#Library-Search">Library Search</a>.  To make a permanent change to
<code>load-path</code>, use the <samp><span class="option">--enable-locallisppath</span></samp> option
of <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.

   </p><p>In a package that can be preloaded, it is sometimes necessary (or
useful) to delay certain evaluations until Emacs subsequently starts
up.  The vast majority of such cases relate to the values of
customizable variables.  For example, <code>tutorial-directory</code> is a
variable defined in <samp><span class="file">startup.el</span></samp>, which is preloaded.  The default
value is set based on <code>data-directory</code>.  The variable needs to
access the value of <code>data-directory</code> when Emacs starts, not when
it is dumped, because the Emacs executable has probably been installed
in a different location since it was dumped.

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/custom%2Dinitialize%2Ddelay"></a><a name="DASH-294"></a>— Function: <b>custom-initialize-delay</b><var> symbol value<a name="index-custom_002dinitialize_002ddelay-4408"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function delays the initialization of <var>symbol</var> to the next

   <p>In the unlikely event that you need a more general functionality than

        </p><p>If you want to use this function in an Emacs that was already dumped,
you must run Emacs with ‘<samp><span class="samp">-batch</span></samp>’.
