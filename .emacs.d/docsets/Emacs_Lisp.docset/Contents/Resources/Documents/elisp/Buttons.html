  The Button package defines functions for inserting and manipulating
<dfn>buttons</dfn> that can be activated with the mouse or via keyboard
commands.  These buttons are typically used for various kinds of
hyperlinks.

   <p>A button is essentially a set of text or overlay properties,
attached to a stretch of text in a buffer.  These properties are
called <dfn>button properties</dfn>.  One of these properties, the
<dfn>action property</dfn>, specifies a function which is called when the
user invokes the button using the keyboard or the mouse.  The action
function may examine the button and use its other properties as
desired.

   <p>In some ways, the Button package duplicates the functionality in the
Widget package.  See <a href="../widget/index.html#Top">Introduction</a>.  The advantage of the Button package is that it is faster,
smaller, and simpler to program.  From the point of view of the user,
the interfaces produced by the two packages are very similar.
