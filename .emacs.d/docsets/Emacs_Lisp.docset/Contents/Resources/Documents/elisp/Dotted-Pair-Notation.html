<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.6.2 Dotted Pair Notation</h5>

<p><a name="index-dotted-pair-notation-101"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_002e_007d-in-lists-102"></a>
  <dfn>Dotted pair notation</dfn> is a general syntax for cons cells that
represents the <span class="sc">car</span> and <span class="sc">cdr</span> explicitly.  In this syntax,
<code>(</code><var>a</var><code> . </code><var>b</var><code>)</code> stands for a cons cell whose <span class="sc">car</span> is
the object <var>a</var> and whose <span class="sc">cdr</span> is the object <var>b</var>.  Dotted
pair notation is more general than list syntax because the <span class="sc">cdr</span>
does not have to be a list.  However, it is more cumbersome in cases
where list syntax would work.  In dotted pair notation, the list
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(1 2 3)</span></samp>&rsquo; is written as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(1 .  (2 . (3 . nil)))</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For
<code>nil</code>-terminated lists, you can use either notation, but list
notation is usually clearer and more convenient.  When printing a
list, the dotted pair notation is only used if the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a cons
cell is not a list.

   <p>Here's an example using boxes to illustrate dotted pair notation. 
This example shows the pair <code>(rose . violet)</code>:

<pre class="example">         --- ---
        |   |   |--&gt; violet
         --- ---
          |
          |
           --&gt; rose
</pre>
   <p>You can combine dotted pair notation with list notation to represent
conveniently a chain of cons cells with a non-<code>nil</code> final <span class="sc">cdr</span>. 
You write a dot after the last element of the list, followed by the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> of the final cons cell.  For example, <code>(rose violet
. buttercup)</code> is equivalent to <code>(rose . (violet . buttercup))</code>. 
The object looks like this:

<pre class="example">         --- ---      --- ---
        |   |   |--&gt; |   |   |--&gt; buttercup
         --- ---      --- ---
          |            |
          |            |
           --&gt; rose     --&gt; violet
</pre>
   <p>The syntax <code>(rose . violet . buttercup)</code> is invalid because
there is nothing that it could mean.  If anything, it would say to put
<code>buttercup</code> in the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a cons cell whose <span class="sc">cdr</span> is already
used for <code>violet</code>.

   <p>The list <code>(rose violet)</code> is equivalent to <code>(rose . (violet))</code>,
and looks like this:

<pre class="example">         --- ---      --- ---
        |   |   |--&gt; |   |   |--&gt; nil
         --- ---      --- ---
          |            |
          |            |
           --&gt; rose     --&gt; violet
</pre>
   <p>Similarly, the three-element list <code>(rose violet buttercup)</code>
is equivalent to <code>(rose . (violet . (buttercup)))</code>. 
It looks like this:

<pre class="example">         --- ---      --- ---      --- ---
        |   |   |--&gt; |   |   |--&gt; |   |   |--&gt; nil
         --- ---      --- ---      --- ---
          |            |            |
          |            |            |
           --&gt; rose     --&gt; violet   --&gt; buttercup
</pre>
