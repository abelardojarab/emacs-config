<h4 class="subsection">2.3.9 Vector Type</h4>

<p>A <dfn>vector</dfn> is a one-dimensional array of elements of any type.  It
takes a constant amount of time to access any element of a vector.  (In
a list, the access time of an element is proportional to the distance of
the element from the beginning of the list.)

   <p>The printed representation of a vector consists of a left square
bracket, the elements, and a right square bracket.  This is also the
read syntax.  Like numbers and strings, vectors are considered constants
for evaluation.

<pre class="example">     [1 "two" (three)]      ; <span class="roman">A vector of three elements.</span>
          &rArr; [1 "two" (three)]
</pre>
   <p>See <a href="Vectors.html#Vectors">Vectors</a>, for functions that work with vectors.
