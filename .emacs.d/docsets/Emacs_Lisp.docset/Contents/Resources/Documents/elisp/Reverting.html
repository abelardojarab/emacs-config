<h3 class="section">25.3 Reverting</h3>

<p>If you have made extensive changes to a file and then change your mind
about them, you can get rid of them by reading in the previous version
of the file with the <code>revert-buffer</code> command.  See <a href="../emacs/Reverting.html#Reverting">Reverting a Buffer</a>.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/revert%2Dbuffer"></a><a name="DASH-1771"></a>— Command: <b>revert-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional ignore-auto noconfirm preserve-modes<a name="index-revert_002dbuffer-2130"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command replaces the buffer text with the text of the visited
file on disk.  This action undoes all changes since the file was visited
or saved.

        </p><p>By default, if the latest auto-save file is more recent than the visited
file, and the argument <var>ignore-auto</var> is <code>nil</code>,
<code>revert-buffer</code> asks the user whether to use that auto-save
instead.  When you invoke this command interactively, <var>ignore-auto</var>
is <code>t</code> if there is no numeric prefix argument; thus, the
interactive default is not to check the auto-save file.

        </p><p>Normally, <code>revert-buffer</code> asks for confirmation before it changes
the buffer; but if the argument <var>noconfirm</var> is non-<code>nil</code>,
<code>revert-buffer</code> does not ask for confirmation.

        </p><p>Normally, this command reinitializes the buffer's major and minor modes
using <code>normal-mode</code>.  But if <var>preserve-modes</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, the modes remain unchanged.

        </p><p>Reverting tries to preserve marker positions in the buffer by using the
replacement feature of <code>insert-file-contents</code>.  If the buffer
contents and the file contents are identical before the revert
operation, reverting preserves all the markers.  If they are not
identical, reverting does change the buffer; in that case, it preserves
the markers in the unchanged text (if any) at the beginning and end of
the buffer.  Preserving any additional markers would be problematical. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/revert%2Dbuffer%2Din%2Dprogress%2Dp"></a><a name="DASH-1772"></a>— Variable: <b>revert-buffer-in-progress-p</b><var><a name="index-revert_002dbuffer_002din_002dprogress_002dp-2131"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><code>revert-buffer</code> binds this variable to a non-<code>nil</code> value
while it is working. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>You can customize how <code>revert-buffer</code> does its work by setting
the variables described in the rest of this section.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/revert%2Dwithout%2Dquery"></a><a name="DASH-1773"></a>— User Option: <b>revert-without-query</b><var><a name="index-revert_002dwithout_002dquery-2132"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable holds a list of files that should be reverted without
query.  The value is a list of regular expressions.  If the visited file
name matches one of these regular expressions, and the file has changed
on disk but the buffer is not modified, then <code>revert-buffer</code>
reverts the file without asking the user for confirmation. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Some major modes customize <code>revert-buffer</code> by making
buffer-local bindings for these variables:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/revert%2Dbuffer%2Dfunction"></a><a name="DASH-1774"></a>— Variable: <b>revert-buffer-function</b><var><a name="index-revert_002dbuffer_002dfunction-2133"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="Definition-of-revert_002dbuffer_002dfunction"></a>The value of this variable is the function to use to revert this
buffer.  It should be a function with two optional
arguments to do the work of reverting.  The two optional arguments,
<var>ignore-auto</var> and <var>noconfirm</var>, are the arguments that
<code>revert-buffer</code> received.

        </p><p>Modes such as Dired mode, in which the text being edited does not
consist of a file's contents but can be regenerated in some other
fashion, can give this variable a buffer-local value that is a special
function to regenerate the contents. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/revert%2Dbuffer%2Dinsert%2Dfile%2Dcontents%2Dfunction"></a><a name="DASH-1775"></a>— Variable: <b>revert-buffer-insert-file-contents-function</b><var><a name="index-revert_002dbuffer_002dinsert_002dfile_002dcontents_002dfunction-2134"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable specifies the function to use to
insert the updated contents when reverting this buffer.  The function
receives two arguments: first the file name to use; second, <code>t</code> if
the user has asked to read the auto-save file.

        </p><p>The reason for a mode to change this variable instead of
<code>revert-buffer-function</code> is to avoid duplicating or replacing the
rest of what <code>revert-buffer</code> does: asking for confirmation,
clearing the undo list, deciding the proper major mode, and running the
hooks listed below. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/before%2Drevert%2Dhook"></a><a name="DASH-1776"></a>— Variable: <b>before-revert-hook</b><var><a name="index-before_002drevert_002dhook-2135"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This normal hook is run by the default <code>revert-buffer-function</code>
before inserting the modified contents.  A custom <code>revert-buffer-function</code>
may or may not run this hook. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/after%2Drevert%2Dhook"></a><a name="DASH-1777"></a>— Variable: <b>after-revert-hook</b><var><a name="index-after_002drevert_002dhook-2136"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This normal hook is run by the default <code>revert-buffer-function</code>
after inserting the modified contents.  A custom <code>revert-buffer-function</code>
may or may not run this hook. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<!-- FIXME?  Move this section from arevert-xtra to here? -->
<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/buffer%2Dstale%2Dfunction"></a><a name="DASH-1778"></a>— Variable: <b>buffer-stale-function</b><var><a name="index-buffer_002dstale_002dfunction-2137"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable specifies a function to call to check
whether a buffer needs reverting.  The default value only handles
buffers that are visiting files, by checking their modification time. 
Buffers that are not visiting files require a custom function
(see <a href="../emacs/Supporting-additional-buffers.html#Supporting-additional-buffers">Supporting additional buffers</a>).
