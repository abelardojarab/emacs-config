<h4 class="subsection">20.7.7 Repeat Events</h4>

<p><a name="index-repeat-events-1360"></a><a name="index-double_002dclick-events-1361"></a><a name="index-triple_002dclick-events-1362"></a><a name="index-mouse-events_002c-repeated-1363"></a>
If you press the same mouse button more than once in quick succession
without moving the mouse, Emacs generates special <dfn>repeat</dfn> mouse
events for the second and subsequent presses.

   </p><p>The most common repeat events are <dfn>double-click</dfn> events.  Emacs
generates a double-click event when you click a button twice; the event
happens when you release the button (as is normal for all click
events).

   </p><p>The event type of a double-click event contains the prefix
‘<samp><span class="samp">double-</span></samp>’.  Thus, a double click on the second mouse button with
&lt;meta&gt; held down comes to the Lisp program as
<code>M-double-mouse-2</code>.  If a double-click event has no binding, the
binding of the corresponding ordinary click event is used to execute
it.  Thus, you need not pay attention to the double click feature
unless you really want to.

   </p><p>When the user performs a double click, Emacs generates first an ordinary
click event, and then a double-click event.  Therefore, you must design
the command binding of the double click event to assume that the
single-click command has already run.  It must produce the desired
results of a double click, starting from the results of a single click.

   </p><p>This is convenient, if the meaning of a double click somehow “builds
on” the meaning of a single click—which is recommended user interface
design practice for double clicks.

   </p><p>If you click a button, then press it down again and start moving the
mouse with the button held down, then you get a <dfn>double-drag</dfn> event
when you ultimately release the button.  Its event type contains
‘<samp><span class="samp">double-drag</span></samp>’ instead of just ‘<samp><span class="samp">drag</span></samp>’.  If a double-drag event
has no binding, Emacs looks for an alternate binding as if the event
were an ordinary drag.

   </p><p>Before the double-click or double-drag event, Emacs generates a
<dfn>double-down</dfn> event when the user presses the button down for the
second time.  Its event type contains ‘<samp><span class="samp">double-down</span></samp>’ instead of just
‘<samp><span class="samp">down</span></samp>’.  If a double-down event has no binding, Emacs looks for an
alternate binding as if the event were an ordinary button-down event. 
If it finds no binding that way either, the double-down event is
ignored.

   </p><p>To summarize, when you click a button and then press it again right
away, Emacs generates a down event and a click event for the first
click, a double-down event when you press the button again, and finally
either a double-click or a double-drag event.

   </p><p>If you click a button twice and then press it again, all in quick
succession, Emacs generates a <dfn>triple-down</dfn> event, followed by
either a <dfn>triple-click</dfn> or a <dfn>triple-drag</dfn>.  The event types of
these events contain ‘<samp><span class="samp">triple</span></samp>’ instead of ‘<samp><span class="samp">double</span></samp>’.  If any
triple event has no binding, Emacs uses the binding that it would use
for the corresponding double event.

   </p><p>If you click a button three or more times and then press it again, the
events for the presses beyond the third are all triple events.  Emacs
does not have separate event types for quadruple, quintuple, etc. 
events.  However, you can look at the event list to find out precisely
how many times the button was pressed.

<blockquote><p>This function returns the number of consecutive button presses that led
up to <var>event</var>.  If <var>event</var> is a double-down, double-click or
double-drag event, the value is 2.  If <var>event</var> is a triple event,

<blockquote><p>To generate repeat events, successive mouse button presses must be at
approximately the same screen position.  The value of
<code>double-click-fuzz</code> specifies the maximum number of pixels the
mouse may be moved (horizontally or vertically) between two successive
clicks to make a double-click.

        </p><p>This variable is also the threshold for motion of the mouse to count
as a drag.

<blockquote><p>To generate repeat events, the number of milliseconds between
successive button presses must be less than the value of
<code>double-click-time</code>.  Setting <code>double-click-time</code> to
<code>nil</code> disables multi-click detection entirely.  Setting it to
<code>t</code> removes the time limit; Emacs then detects multi-clicks by
position only.
