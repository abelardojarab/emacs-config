<h3 class="section">36.10 Sentinels: Detecting Process Status Changes</h3>

<p><a name="index-process-sentinel-3666"></a><a name="index-sentinel-_0028of-process_0029-3667"></a>
  A <dfn>process sentinel</dfn> is a function that is called whenever the
associated process changes status for any reason, including signals
(whether sent by Emacs or caused by the process's own actions) that
terminate, stop, or continue the process.  The process sentinel is
also called if the process exits.  The sentinel receives two
arguments: the process for which the event occurred, and a string
describing the type of event.

   </p><p>The string describing the event looks like one of the following:

<!-- FIXME?  Also "killed\n" - see example below? -->
     </p><ul>
<li><code>"finished\n"</code>.

     </li><li><code>"exited abnormally with code </code><var>exitcode</var><code>\n"</code>.

     </li><li><code>"</code><var>name-of-signal</var><code>\n"</code>.

     </li><li><code>"</code><var>name-of-signal</var><code> (core dumped)\n"</code>. 
</li></ul>

   <p>A sentinel runs only while Emacs is waiting (e.g., for terminal
input, or for time to elapse, or for process output).  This avoids the
timing errors that could result from running sentinels at random places in
the middle of other Lisp programs.  A program can wait, so that
sentinels will run, by calling <code>sit-for</code> or <code>sleep-for</code>
(see <a href="Waiting.html#Waiting">Waiting</a>), or <code>accept-process-output</code> (see <a href="Accepting-Output.html#Accepting-Output">Accepting Output</a>).  Emacs also allows sentinels to run when the command loop is
reading input.  <code>delete-process</code> calls the sentinel when it
terminates a running process.

   </p><p>Emacs does not keep a queue of multiple reasons to call the sentinel
of one process; it records just the current status and the fact that
there has been a change.  Therefore two changes in status, coming in
quick succession, can call the sentinel just once.  However, process
termination will always run the sentinel exactly once.  This is
because the process status can't change again after termination.

   </p><p>Emacs explicitly checks for output from the process before running
the process sentinel.  Once the sentinel runs due to process
termination, no further output can arrive from the process.

   </p><p>A sentinel that writes the output into the buffer of the process
should check whether the buffer is still alive.  If it tries to insert
into a dead buffer, it will get an error.  If the buffer is dead,
<code>(buffer-name (process-buffer </code><var>process</var><code>))</code> returns <code>nil</code>.

<!-- Note this text is duplicated in the filter functions section. -->
   </p><p>Quitting is normally inhibited within a sentinel—otherwise, the
effect of typing <kbd>C-g</kbd> at command level or to quit a user command
would be unpredictable.  If you want to permit quitting inside a
sentinel, bind <code>inhibit-quit</code> to <code>nil</code>.  In most cases, the
right way to do this is with the macro <code>with-local-quit</code>. 
See <a href="Quitting.html#Quitting">Quitting</a>.

   </p><p>If an error happens during execution of a sentinel, it is caught
automatically, so that it doesn't stop the execution of whatever
programs was running when the sentinel was started.  However, if
<code>debug-on-error</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,  errors are not caught. 
This makes it possible to use the Lisp debugger to debug the
sentinel.  See <a href="Debugger.html#Debugger">Debugger</a>.

   </p><p>While a sentinel is running, the process sentinel is temporarily
set to <code>nil</code> so that the sentinel won't run recursively. 
For this reason it is not possible for a sentinel to specify
a new sentinel.

   </p><p>Note that Emacs automatically saves and restores the match data
while executing sentinels.  See <a href="Match-Data.html#Match-Data">Match Data</a>.

<var>sentinel</var> is <code>nil</code>, then the process will have the default
sentinel, which inserts a message in the process's buffer when the
process status changes.

        </p><p>Changes in process sentinels take effect immediately—if the sentinel
is slated to be run but has not been called yet, and you specify a new
sentinel, the eventual call to the sentinel will use the new one.

   <p>In case a process status changes need to be passed to several sentinels, you
can use <code>add-function</code> to combine an existing sentinel with a new one.
