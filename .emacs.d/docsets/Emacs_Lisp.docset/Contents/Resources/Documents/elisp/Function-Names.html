<h3 class="section">12.3 Naming a Function</h3>

<p><a name="index-function-definition-747"></a><a name="index-named-function-748"></a><a name="index-function-name-749"></a>
  A symbol can serve as the name of a function.  This happens when the
symbol's <dfn>function cell</dfn> (see <a href="Symbol-Components.html#Symbol-Components">Symbol Components</a>) contains a
function object (e.g., a lambda expression).  Then the symbol itself
becomes a valid, callable function, equivalent to the function object
in its function cell.

   <p>The contents of the function cell are also called the symbol's
<dfn>function definition</dfn>.  The procedure of using a symbol's function
definition in place of the symbol is called <dfn>symbol function
indirection</dfn>; see <a href="Function-Indirection.html#Function-Indirection">Function Indirection</a>.  If you have not given a
symbol a function definition, its function cell is said to be
<dfn>void</dfn>, and it cannot be used as a function.

   <p>In practice, nearly all functions have names, and are referred to by
their names.  You can create a named Lisp function by defining a
lambda expression and putting it in a function cell (see <a href="Function-Cells.html#Function-Cells">Function Cells</a>).  However, it is more common to use the <code>defun</code> special
form, described in the next section. 
See <a href="Defining-Functions.html#Defining-Functions">Defining Functions</a>.

   <p>We give functions names because it is convenient to refer to them by
their names in Lisp expressions.  Also, a named Lisp function can
easily refer to itself&mdash;it can be recursive.  Furthermore, primitives
can only be referred to textually by their names, since primitive
function objects (see <a href="Primitive-Function-Type.html#Primitive-Function-Type">Primitive Function Type</a>) have no read
syntax.

   <p>A function need not have a unique name.  A given function object
<em>usually</em> appears in the function cell of only one symbol, but
this is just a convention.  It is easy to store it in several symbols
using <code>fset</code>; then each of the symbols is a valid name for the
same function.

   <p>Note that a symbol used as a function name may also be used as a
variable; these two uses of a symbol are independent and do not
conflict.  (This is not the case in some dialects of Lisp, like
Scheme.)
