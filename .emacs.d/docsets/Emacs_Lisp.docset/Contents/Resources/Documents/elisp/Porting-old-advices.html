<h4 class="subsection">12.10.4 Adapting code using the old defadvice</h4>

<p>A lot of code uses the old <code>defadvice</code> mechanism, which is largely made
obsolete by the new <code>advice-add</code>, whose implementation and semantics is
significantly simpler.

   <p>An old advice such as:

<pre class="example">     (defadvice previous-line (before next-line-at-end
                                      (&amp;optional arg try-vscroll))
       "Insert an empty line when moving up from the top line."
       (if (and next-line-add-newlines (= arg 1)
                (save-excursion (beginning-of-line) (bobp)))
           (progn
             (beginning-of-line)
             (newline))))
</pre>
   <p>could be translated in the new advice mechanism into a plain function:

<pre class="example">     (defun previous-line--next-line-at-end (&amp;optional arg try-vscroll)
       "Insert an empty line when moving up from the top line."
       (if (and next-line-add-newlines (= arg 1)
                (save-excursion (beginning-of-line) (bobp)))
           (progn
             (beginning-of-line)
             (newline))))
</pre>
   <p>Obviously, this does not actually modify <code>previous-line</code>.  For that the
old advice needed:
<pre class="example">     (ad-activate 'previous-line)
</pre>
   <p>whereas the new advice mechanism needs:
<pre class="example">     (advice-add 'previous-line :before #'previous-line--next-line-at-end)
</pre>
   <p>Note that <code>ad-activate</code> had a global effect: it activated all pieces of
advice enabled for that specified function.  If you wanted to only activate or
deactivate a particular advice, you needed to <em>enable</em> or <em>disable</em>
that advice with <code>ad-enable-advice</code> and <code>ad-disable-advice</code>. 
The new mechanism does away with this distinction.

   <p>An around advice such as:

<pre class="example">     (defadvice foo (around foo-around)
       "Ignore case in `foo'."
       (let ((case-fold-search t))
         ad-do-it))
     (ad-activate 'foo)
</pre>
   <p>could translate into:

<pre class="example">     (defun foo--foo-around (orig-fun &amp;rest args)
       "Ignore case in `foo'."
       (let ((case-fold-search t))
         (apply orig-fun args)))
     (advice-add 'foo :around #'foo--foo-around)
</pre>
   <p>Regarding the advice's <em>class</em>, note that the new <code>:before</code> is not
quite equivalent to the old <code>before</code>, because in the old advice you could
modify the function's arguments (e.g., with <code>ad-set-arg</code>), and that would
affect the argument values seen by the original function, whereas in the new
<code>:before</code>, modifying an argument via <code>setq</code> in the advice has no
effect on the arguments seen by the original function. 
When porting a <code>before</code> advice which relied on this behavior, you'll need
to turn it into a new <code>:around</code> or <code>:filter-args</code> advice instead.

   <p>Similarly an old <code>after</code> advice could modify the returned value by
changing <code>ad-return-value</code>, whereas a new <code>:after</code> advice cannot, so
when porting such an old <code>after</code> advice, you'll need to turn it into a new
<code>:around</code> or <code>:filter-return</code> advice instead.
