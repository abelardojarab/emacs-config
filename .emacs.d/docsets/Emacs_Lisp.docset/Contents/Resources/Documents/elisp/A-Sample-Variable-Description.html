<h5 class="subsubsection">1.3.7.2 A Sample Variable Description</h5>

<p><a name="index-variable-descriptions-29"></a><a name="index-option-descriptions-30"></a>
  A <dfn>variable</dfn> is a name that can be <dfn>bound</dfn> (or <dfn>set</dfn>) to
an object.  The object to which a variable is bound is called a
<dfn>value</dfn>; we say also that variable holds that value. 
Although nearly all variables can be set by the user, certain
variables exist specifically so that users can change them; these are
called <dfn>user options</dfn>.  Ordinary variables and user options are
described using a format like that for functions, except that there
are no arguments.

   </p><p>Here is a description of the imaginary <code>electric-future-map</code>
variable.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/electric%2Dfuture%2Dmap"></a><a name="DASH-3"></a>— Variable: <b>electric-future-map</b><var><a name="index-electric_002dfuture_002dmap-31"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is a full keymap used by Electric Command
Future mode.  The functions in this map allow you to edit commands you
have not yet thought about executing. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>User option descriptions have the same format, but ‘<samp><span class="samp">Variable</span></samp>’
is replaced by ‘<samp><span class="samp">User Option</span></samp>’.
