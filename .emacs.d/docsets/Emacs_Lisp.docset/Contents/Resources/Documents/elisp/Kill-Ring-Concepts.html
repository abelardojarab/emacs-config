<h4 class="subsection">31.8.1 Kill Ring Concepts</h4>

<p>The kill ring records killed text as strings in a list, most recent
first.  A short kill ring, for example, might look like this:

<pre class="example">     ("some text" "a different piece of text" "even older text")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When the list reaches <code>kill-ring-max</code> entries in length, adding a
new entry automatically deletes the last entry.

   <p>When kill commands are interwoven with other commands, each kill
command makes a new entry in the kill ring.  Multiple kill commands in
succession build up a single kill ring entry, which would be yanked as a
unit; the second and subsequent consecutive kill commands add text to
the entry made by the first one.

   <p>For yanking, one entry in the kill ring is designated the &ldquo;front&rdquo; of
the ring.  Some yank commands &ldquo;rotate&rdquo; the ring by designating a
different element as the &ldquo;front&rdquo;.  But this virtual rotation doesn't
change the list itself&mdash;the most recent entry always comes first in the
list.
