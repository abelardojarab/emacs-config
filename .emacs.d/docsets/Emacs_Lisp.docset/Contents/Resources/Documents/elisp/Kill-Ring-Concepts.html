<h4 class="subsection">31.8.1 Kill Ring Concepts</h4>

<p>The kill ring records killed text as strings in a list, most recent
first.  A short kill ring, for example, might look like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(&quot;some text&quot; &quot;a different piece of text&quot; &quot;even older text&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>When the list reaches <code>kill-ring-max</code> entries in length, adding a
new entry automatically deletes the last entry.
</p>
<p>When kill commands are interwoven with other commands, each kill
command makes a new entry in the kill ring.  Multiple kill commands in
succession build up a single kill ring entry, which would be yanked as a
unit; the second and subsequent consecutive kill commands add text to
the entry made by the first one.
</p>
<p>For yanking, one entry in the kill ring is designated the front of
the ring.  Some yank commands rotate the ring by designating a
different element as the front.  But this virtual rotation doesn&rsquo;t
change the list itself&mdash;the most recent entry always comes first in the
list.
