<h2 class="chapter">35 Abbrevs and Abbrev Expansion</h2>

<p><a name="index-abbrev-3534"></a><!-- @cindex abbrev table  Redundant with "abbrev". -->

   <p>An abbreviation or <dfn>abbrev</dfn> is a string of characters that may be
expanded to a longer string.  The user can insert the abbrev string and
find it replaced automatically with the expansion of the abbrev.  This
saves typing.

   <p>The set of abbrevs currently in effect is recorded in an <dfn>abbrev
table</dfn>.  Each buffer has a local abbrev table, but normally all buffers
in the same major mode share one abbrev table.  There is also a global
abbrev table.  Normally both are used.

   <p>An abbrev table is represented as an obarray.  See <a href="Creating-Symbols.html#Creating-Symbols">Creating Symbols</a>, for information about obarrays.  Each abbreviation is
represented by a symbol in the obarray.  The symbol's name is the
abbreviation; its value is the expansion; its function definition is
the hook function for performing the expansion (see <a href="Defining-Abbrevs.html#Defining-Abbrevs">Defining Abbrevs</a>); and its property list cell contains various additional
properties, including the use count and the number of times the
abbreviation has been expanded (see <a href="Abbrev-Properties.html#Abbrev-Properties">Abbrev Properties</a>).

   <p><a name="index-system-abbrev-3535"></a>  Certain abbrevs, called <dfn>system abbrevs</dfn>, are defined by a major
mode instead of the user.  A system abbrev is identified by its
non-<code>nil</code> <code>:system</code> property (see <a href="Abbrev-Properties.html#Abbrev-Properties">Abbrev Properties</a>). 
When abbrevs are saved to an abbrev file, system abbrevs are omitted. 
See <a href="Abbrev-Files.html#Abbrev-Files">Abbrev Files</a>.

   <p>Because the symbols used for abbrevs are not interned in the usual
obarray, they will never appear as the result of reading a Lisp
expression; in fact, normally they are never used except by the code
that handles abbrevs.  Therefore, it is safe to use them in a
nonstandard way.

   <p>If the minor mode Abbrev mode is enabled, the buffer-local variable
<code>abbrev-mode</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, and abbrevs are automatically
expanded in the buffer.  For the user-level commands for abbrevs, see
<a href="../emacs/Abbrevs.html#Abbrevs">Abbrev Mode</a>.
