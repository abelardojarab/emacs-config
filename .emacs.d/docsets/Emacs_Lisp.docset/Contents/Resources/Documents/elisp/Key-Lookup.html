<h3 class="section">21.10 Key Lookup</h3>

<p><a name="index-key-lookup-1591"></a><a name="index-keymap-entry-1592"></a>
  <dfn>Key lookup</dfn> is the process of finding the binding of a key
sequence from a given keymap.  The execution or use of the binding is
not part of key lookup.

   <p>Key lookup uses just the event type of each event in the key sequence;
the rest of the event is ignored.  In fact, a key sequence used for key
lookup may designate a mouse event with just its types (a symbol)
instead of the entire event (a list).  See <a href="Input-Events.html#Input-Events">Input Events</a>.  Such
a &ldquo;key sequence&rdquo; is insufficient for <code>command-execute</code> to run,
but it is sufficient for looking up or rebinding a key.

   <p>When the key sequence consists of multiple events, key lookup
processes the events sequentially: the binding of the first event is
found, and must be a keymap; then the second event's binding is found in
that keymap, and so on until all the events in the key sequence are used
up.  (The binding thus found for the last event may or may not be a
keymap.)  Thus, the process of key lookup is defined in terms of a
simpler process for looking up a single event in a keymap.  How that is
done depends on the type of object associated with the event in that
keymap.

   <p>Let's use the term <dfn>keymap entry</dfn> to describe the value found by
looking up an event type in a keymap.  (This doesn't include the item
string and other extra elements in a keymap element for a menu item, because
<code>lookup-key</code> and other key lookup functions don't include them in
the returned value.)  While any Lisp object may be stored in a keymap
as a keymap entry, not all make sense for key lookup.  Here is a table
of the meaningful types of keymap entries:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnil_007d-in-keymap-1593"></a><code>nil</code> means that the events used so far in the lookup form an
undefined key.  When a keymap fails to mention an event type at all, and
has no default binding, that is equivalent to a binding of <code>nil</code>
for that event type.

     <br><dt><var>command</var><dd><a name="index-command-in-keymap-1594"></a>The events used so far in the lookup form a complete key,
and <var>command</var> is its binding.  See <a href="What-Is-a-Function.html#What-Is-a-Function">What Is a Function</a>.

     <br><dt><var>array</var><dd><a name="index-string-in-keymap-1595"></a>The array (either a string or a vector) is a keyboard macro.  The events
used so far in the lookup form a complete key, and the array is its
binding.  See <a href="Keyboard-Macros.html#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><var>keymap</var><dd><a name="index-keymap-in-keymap-1596"></a>The events used so far in the lookup form a prefix key.  The next
event of the key sequence is looked up in <var>keymap</var>.

     <br><dt><var>list</var><dd><a name="index-list-in-keymap-1597"></a>The meaning of a list depends on what it contains:

          <ul>
<li>If the <span class="sc">car</span> of <var>list</var> is the symbol <code>keymap</code>, then the list
is a keymap, and is treated as a keymap (see above).

          <li><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blambda_007d-in-keymap-1598"></a>If the <span class="sc">car</span> of <var>list</var> is <code>lambda</code>, then the list is a
lambda expression.  This is presumed to be a function, and is treated
as such (see above).  In order to execute properly as a key binding,
this function must be a command&mdash;it must have an <code>interactive</code>
specification.  See <a href="Defining-Commands.html#Defining-Commands">Defining Commands</a>.

          <li>If the <span class="sc">car</span> of <var>list</var> is a keymap and the <span class="sc">cdr</span> is an event
type, then this is an <dfn>indirect entry</dfn>:

          <pre class="example">               (<var>othermap</var> . <var>othertype</var>)
</pre>
          <p>When key lookup encounters an indirect entry, it looks up instead the
binding of <var>othertype</var> in <var>othermap</var> and uses that.

          <p>This feature permits you to define one key as an alias for another key. 
For example, an entry whose <span class="sc">car</span> is the keymap called <code>esc-map</code>
and whose <span class="sc">cdr</span> is 32 (the code for &lt;SPC&gt;) means, &ldquo;Use the global
binding of <kbd>Meta-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, whatever that may be&rdquo;. 
</ul>

     <br><dt><var>symbol</var><dd><a name="index-symbol-in-keymap-1599"></a>The function definition of <var>symbol</var> is used in place of
<var>symbol</var>.  If that too is a symbol, then this process is repeated,
any number of times.  Ultimately this should lead to an object that is
a keymap, a command, or a keyboard macro.  A list is allowed if it is a
keymap or a command, but indirect entries are not understood when found
via symbols.

     <p>Note that keymaps and keyboard macros (strings and vectors) are not
valid functions, so a symbol with a keymap, string, or vector as its
function definition is invalid as a function.  It is, however, valid as
a key binding.  If the definition is a keyboard macro, then the symbol
is also valid as an argument to <code>command-execute</code>
(see <a href="Interactive-Call.html#Interactive-Call">Interactive Call</a>).

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bundefined_007d-in-keymap-1600"></a>The symbol <code>undefined</code> is worth special mention: it means to treat
the key as undefined.  Strictly speaking, the key is defined, and its
binding is the command <code>undefined</code>; but that command does the same
thing that is done automatically for an undefined key: it rings the bell
(by calling <code>ding</code>) but does not signal an error.

     <p><a name="index-preventing-prefix-key-1601"></a><code>undefined</code> is used in local keymaps to override a global key
binding and make the key &ldquo;undefined&rdquo; locally.  A local binding of
<code>nil</code> would fail to do this because it would not override the
global binding.

     <br><dt><var>anything else</var><dd>If any other type of object is found, the events used so far in the
lookup form a complete key, and the object is its binding, but the
binding is not executable as a command. 
</dl>

   <p>In short, a keymap entry may be a keymap, a command, a keyboard
macro, a symbol that leads to one of them, or an indirection or
<code>nil</code>.
