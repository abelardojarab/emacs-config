<h3 class="section">10.1 Sequencing</h3>

<p>Evaluating forms in the order they appear is the most common way
control passes from one form to another.  In some contexts, such as in a
function body, this happens automatically.  Elsewhere you must use a
control structure construct to do this: <code>progn</code>, the simplest
control construct of Lisp.

   </p><p>A <code>progn</code> special form looks like this:

</p><pre class="example">     (progn <var>a</var> <var>b</var> <var>c</var> ...)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and it says to execute the forms <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>, and so on, in
that order.  These forms are called the <dfn>body</dfn> of the <code>progn</code> form. 
The value of the last form in the body becomes the value of the entire
<code>progn</code>.  <code>(progn)</code> returns <code>nil</code>.

   </p><p><a name="index-implicit-_0040code_007bprogn_007d-559"></a>  In the early days of Lisp, <code>progn</code> was the only way to execute
two or more forms in succession and use the value of the last of them. 
But programmers found they often needed to use a <code>progn</code> in the
body of a function, where (at that time) only one form was allowed.  So
the body of a function was made into an “implicit <code>progn</code>”:
several forms are allowed just as in the body of an actual <code>progn</code>. 
Many other control structures likewise contain an implicit <code>progn</code>. 
As a result, <code>progn</code> is not used as much as it was many years ago. 
It is needed now most often inside an <code>unwind-protect</code>, <code>and</code>,
<code>or</code>, or in the <var>then</var>-part of an <code>if</code>.

<blockquote><p>This special form evaluates all of the <var>forms</var>, in textual
order, returning the result of the final form.

     </p><pre class="example">          (progn (print "The first form")
                 (print "The second form")
                 (print "The third form"))
               -| "The first form"
               -| "The second form"
               -| "The third form"
          ⇒ "The third form"
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>Two other constructs likewise evaluate a series of forms but return
different values:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/prog1"></a><a name="DASH-1854"></a>— Special Form: <b>prog1</b><var> form1 forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-prog1-561"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form evaluates <var>form1</var> and all of the <var>forms</var>, in
textual order, returning the result of <var>form1</var>.

     </p><pre class="example">          (prog1 (print "The first form")
                 (print "The second form")
                 (print "The third form"))
               -| "The first form"
               -| "The second form"
               -| "The third form"
          ⇒ "The first form"
</pre>
        <p>Here is a way to remove the first element from a list in the variable
<code>x</code>, then return the value of that former element:

     </p><pre class="example">          (prog1 (car x) (setq x (cdr x)))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/prog2"></a><a name="DASH-1855"></a>— Special Form: <b>prog2</b><var> form1 form2 forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-prog2-562"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form evaluates <var>form1</var>, <var>form2</var>, and all of the
following <var>forms</var>, in textual order, returning the result of
<var>form2</var>.

     </p><pre class="example">          (prog2 (print "The first form")
                 (print "The second form")
                 (print "The third form"))
               -| "The first form"
               -| "The second form"
               -| "The third form"
          ⇒ "The second form"
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
