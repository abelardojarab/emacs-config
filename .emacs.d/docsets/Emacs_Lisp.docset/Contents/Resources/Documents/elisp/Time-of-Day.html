<h3 class="section">38.5 Time of Day</h3>

<p>This section explains how to determine the current time and time
zone.

   </p><p><a name="index-epoch-4278"></a>  Most of these functions represent time as a list of either four
integers, <code>(</code><var>sec-high</var> <var>sec-low</var> <var>microsec</var>
<var>picosec</var><code>)</code>, or of three
integers, <code>(</code><var>sec-high</var> <var>sec-low</var> <var>microsec</var><code>)</code>, or of
two integers, <code>(</code><var>sec-high</var> <var>sec-low</var><code>)</code>.  The integers
<var>sec-high</var> and <var>sec-low</var> give the high and low bits of an
integer number of seconds.  This integer,
<var>high</var> * 2**16 + <var>low</var>,
is the number of seconds from the <dfn>epoch</dfn> (0:00 January 1, 1970
UTC) to the specified time.  The third list element <var>microsec</var>, if
present, gives the number of microseconds from the start of that
second to the specified time. 
Similarly, the fourth list element <var>picosec</var>, if present, gives
the number of picoseconds from the start of that microsecond to the
specified time.

   </p><p>The return value of <code>current-time</code> represents time using four
integers, as do the timestamps in the return value of
<code>file-attributes</code> (see <a href="Definition-of-file_002dattributes.html#Definition-of-file_002dattributes">Definition of file-attributes</a>).  In function arguments, e.g., the <var>time-value</var>
argument to <code>current-time-string</code>, two-, three-, and four-integer
lists are accepted.  You can convert times from the list
representation into standard human-readable strings using
<code>current-time-string</code>, or to other forms using the
<code>decode-time</code> and <code>format-time-string</code> functions documented
in the following sections.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/current%2Dtime%2Dstring"></a><a name="DASH-2179"></a>— Function: <b>current-time-string</b><var> &amp;optional time-value<a name="index-current_002dtime_002dstring-4279"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the current time and date as a human-readable
string.  The format does not vary for the initial part of the string,
which contains the day of week, month, day of month, and time of day
in that order: the number of characters used for these fields is
always the same, so you can reliably
use <code>substring</code> to extract them.  You should count
characters from the beginning of the string rather than from the end,
as the year might not have exactly four digits, and additional
information may some day be added at the end.

        </p><p>The argument <var>time-value</var>, if given, specifies a time to format
(represented as a list of integers), instead of the current time.

     </p><pre class="example">          (current-time-string)
               ⇒ "Wed Oct 14 22:21:05 1987"
</pre>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/current%2Dtime"></a><a name="DASH-2180"></a>— Function: <b>current-time</b><var><a name="index-current_002dtime-4280"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the current time, represented as a list of four
integers <code>(</code><var>sec-high</var> <var>sec-low</var> <var>microsec</var> <var>picosec</var><code>)</code>. 
These integers have trailing zeros on systems that return time with
lower resolutions.  On all current machines <var>picosec</var> is a
multiple of 1000, but this may change as higher-resolution clocks
become available.

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/float%2Dtime"></a><a name="DASH-2181"></a>— Function: <b>float-time</b><var> &amp;optional time-value<a name="index-float_002dtime-4281"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the current time as a floating-point number of
seconds since the epoch.  The optional argument <var>time-value</var>, if
given, specifies a time (represented as a list of integers) to convert
instead of the current time.

        </p><p><em>Warning</em>: Since the result is floating point, it may not be
exact.  Do not use this function if precise time stamps are required. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/current%2Dtime%2Dzone"></a><a name="DASH-2182"></a>— Function: <b>current-time-zone</b><var> &amp;optional time-value<a name="index-current_002dtime_002dzone-4282"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-time-zone_002c-current-4283"></a>This function returns a list describing the time zone that the user is
in.

        </p><p>The value has the form <code>(</code><var>offset</var> <var>name</var><code>)</code>.  Here
<var>offset</var> is an integer giving the number of seconds ahead of UTC
(east of Greenwich).  A negative value means west of Greenwich.  The
second element, <var>name</var>, is a string giving the name of the time
zone.  Both elements change when daylight saving time begins or ends;
if the user has specified a time zone that does not use a seasonal time
adjustment, then the value is constant through time.

        </p><p>If the operating system doesn't supply all the information necessary to
compute the value, the unknown elements of the list are <code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>The argument <var>time-value</var>, if given, specifies a time (represented
as a list of integers) to analyze instead of the current time. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The current time zone is determined by the <samp><span class="env">TZ</span></samp> environment
variable.  See <a href="System-Environment.html#System-Environment">System Environment</a>.  For example, you can tell Emacs
to use universal time with <code>(setenv "TZ" "UTC0")</code>.  If <samp><span class="env">TZ</span></samp>
is not in the environment, Emacs uses a platform-dependent default
time zone.
