<h3 class="section">9.2 Kinds of Forms</h3>

<p>A Lisp object that is intended to be evaluated is called a
<dfn>form</dfn> (or an <dfn>expression</dfn>).  How Emacs evaluates a form
depends on its data type.  Emacs has three different kinds of form
that are evaluated differently: symbols, lists, and &ldquo;all other
types&rdquo;.  This section describes all three kinds, one by one, starting
with the &ldquo;all other types&rdquo; which are self-evaluating forms.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="Self_002dEvaluating-Forms.html#Self_002dEvaluating-Forms">Self-Evaluating Forms</a>:    Forms that evaluate to themselves. 
<li><a accesskey="2" href="Symbol-Forms.html#Symbol-Forms">Symbol Forms</a>:             Symbols evaluate as variables. 
<li><a accesskey="3" href="Classifying-Lists.html#Classifying-Lists">Classifying Lists</a>:        How to distinguish various sorts of list forms. 
<li><a accesskey="4" href="Function-Indirection.html#Function-Indirection">Function Indirection</a>:     When a symbol appears as the car of a list,
                              we find the real function via the symbol. 
<li><a accesskey="5" href="Function-Forms.html#Function-Forms">Function Forms</a>:           Forms that call functions. 
<li><a accesskey="6" href="Macro-Forms.html#Macro-Forms">Macro Forms</a>:              Forms that call macros. 
<li><a accesskey="7" href="Special-Forms.html#Special-Forms">Special Forms</a>:            "Special forms" are idiosyncratic primitives,
                              most of them extremely important. 
<li><a accesskey="8" href="Autoloading.html#Autoloading">Autoloading</a>:              Functions set up to load files
                              containing their real definitions.
