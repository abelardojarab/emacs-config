<h3 class="section">36.1 Functions that Create Subprocesses</h3>

<p>There are three primitives that create a new subprocess in which to run
a program.  One of them, <code>start-process</code>, creates an asynchronous
process and returns a process object (see <a href="Asynchronous-Processes.html#Asynchronous-Processes">Asynchronous Processes</a>). 
The other two, <code>call-process</code> and <code>call-process-region</code>,
create a synchronous process and do not return a process object
(see <a href="Synchronous-Processes.html#Synchronous-Processes">Synchronous Processes</a>).  There are various higher-level
functions that make use of these primitives to run particular types of
process.

   </p><p>Synchronous and asynchronous processes are explained in the following
sections.  Since the three functions are all called in a similar
fashion, their common arguments are described here.

   </p><p><a name="index-execute-program-3578"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bPATH_007d-environment-variable-3579"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bHOME_007d-environment-variable-3580"></a>  In all cases, the function's <var>program</var> argument specifies the
program to be run.  An error is signaled if the file is not found or
cannot be executed.  If the file name is relative, the variable
<code>exec-path</code> contains a list of directories to search.  Emacs
initializes <code>exec-path</code> when it starts up, based on the value of
the environment variable <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.  The standard file name
constructs, ‘<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>’, and ‘<samp><span class="samp">..</span></samp>’, are interpreted as
usual in <code>exec-path</code>, but environment variable substitutions
(‘<samp><span class="samp">$HOME</span></samp>’, etc.) are not recognized; use
<code>substitute-in-file-name</code> to perform them (see <a href="File-Name-Expansion.html#File-Name-Expansion">File Name Expansion</a>).  <code>nil</code> in this list refers to
<code>default-directory</code>.

   </p><p>Executing a program can also try adding suffixes to the specified
name:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/exec%2Dsuffixes"></a><a name="DASH-1992"></a>— User Option: <b>exec-suffixes</b><var><a name="index-exec_002dsuffixes-3581"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable is a list of suffixes (strings) to try adding to the
specified program file name.  The list should include <code>""</code> if you
want the name to be tried exactly as specified.  The default value is
system-dependent. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><strong>Please note:</strong> The argument <var>program</var> contains only the
name of the program; it may not contain any command-line arguments.  You
must use a separate argument, <var>args</var>, to provide those, as
described below.

   </p><p>Each of the subprocess-creating functions has a <var>buffer-or-name</var>
argument that specifies where the standard output from the program will
go.  It should be a buffer or a buffer name; if it is a buffer name,
that will create the buffer if it does not already exist.  It can also
be <code>nil</code>, which says to discard the output, unless a custom filter function
handles it.  (See <a href="Filter-Functions.html#Filter-Functions">Filter Functions</a>, and <a href="Read-and-Print.html#Read-and-Print">Read and Print</a>.) 
Normally, you should avoid having multiple processes send output to the
same buffer because their output would be intermixed randomly. 
For synchronous processes, you can send the output to a file instead
of a buffer.

   </p><p><a name="index-program-arguments-3582"></a>  All three of the subprocess-creating functions have a <code>&amp;rest</code>
argument, <var>args</var>.  The <var>args</var> must all be strings, and they are
supplied to <var>program</var> as separate command line arguments.  Wildcard
characters and other shell constructs have no special meanings in these
strings, since the strings are passed directly to the specified program.

   </p><p><a name="index-environment-variables_002c-subprocesses-3583"></a>  The subprocess inherits its environment from Emacs, but you can
specify overrides for it with <code>process-environment</code>.  See <a href="System-Environment.html#System-Environment">System Environment</a>.  The subprocess gets its current directory from the
value of <code>default-directory</code>.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/exec%2Ddirectory"></a><a name="DASH-1993"></a>— Variable: <b>exec-directory</b><var><a name="index-exec_002ddirectory-3584"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-movemail-3585"></a>The value of this variable is a string, the name of a directory that
contains programs that come with GNU Emacs and are intended for Emacs
to invoke.  The program <code>movemail</code> is an example of such a program;
Rmail uses it to fetch new mail from an inbox. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/exec%2Dpath"></a><a name="DASH-1994"></a>— User Option: <b>exec-path</b><var><a name="index-exec_002dpath-3586"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is a list of directories to search for
programs to run in subprocesses.  Each element is either the name of a
directory (i.e., a string), or <code>nil</code>, which stands for the default
directory (which is the value of <code>default-directory</code>). 
<a name="index-program-directories-3587"></a>
The value of <code>exec-path</code> is used by <code>call-process</code> and
<code>start-process</code> when the <var>program</var> argument is not an absolute
file name.

        </p><p>Generally, you should not modify <code>exec-path</code> directly.  Instead,
ensure that your <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> environment variable is set appropriately
before starting Emacs.  Trying to modify <code>exec-path</code>
independently of <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> can lead to confusing results. 
</p></blockquote></div>
