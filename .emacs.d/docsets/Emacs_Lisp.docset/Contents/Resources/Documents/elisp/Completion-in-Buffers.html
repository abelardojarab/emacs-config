<h4 class="subsection">19.6.8 Completion in Ordinary Buffers</h4>

<p><a name="index-inline-completion-1233"></a>
<a name="index-completion_002dat_002dpoint-1234"></a>  Although completion is usually done in the minibuffer, the
completion facility can also be used on the text in ordinary Emacs
buffers.  In many major modes, in-buffer completion is performed by
the <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> or <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> command, bound to
<code>completion-at-point</code>.  See <a href="../emacs/Symbol-Completion.html#Symbol-Completion">Symbol Completion</a>.  This command uses the abnormal hook variable
<code>completion-at-point-functions</code>:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/completion%2Dat%2Dpoint%2Dfunctions"></a><a name="DASH-507"></a>— Variable: <b>completion-at-point-functions</b><var><a name="index-completion_002dat_002dpoint_002dfunctions-1235"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this abnormal hook should be a list of functions, which
are used to compute a completion table for completing the text at
point.  It can be used by major modes to provide mode-specific
completion tables (see <a href="Major-Mode-Conventions.html#Major-Mode-Conventions">Major Mode Conventions</a>).

        </p><p>When the command <code>completion-at-point</code> runs, it calls the
functions in the list one by one, without any argument.  Each function
should return <code>nil</code> if it is unable to produce a completion table
for the text at point.  Otherwise it should return a list of the form

     </p><pre class="example">          (<var>start</var> <var>end</var> <var>collection</var> . <var>props</var>)
</pre>
        <p class="noindent"><var>start</var> and <var>end</var> delimit the text to complete (which should
enclose point).  <var>collection</var> is a completion table for completing
that text, in a form suitable for passing as the second argument to
<code>try-completion</code> (see <a href="Basic-Completion.html#Basic-Completion">Basic Completion</a>); completion
alternatives will be generated from this completion table in the usual
way, via the completion styles defined in <code>completion-styles</code>
(see <a href="Completion-Variables.html#Completion-Variables">Completion Variables</a>).  <var>props</var> is a property list for
additional information; any of the properties in
<code>completion-extra-properties</code> are recognized (see <a href="Completion-Variables.html#Completion-Variables">Completion Variables</a>), as well as the following additional ones:

          </p><dl>
<dt><code>:predicate</code></dt><dd>The value should be a predicate that completion candidates need to
satisfy.

          <br></dd><dt><code>:exclusive</code></dt><dd>If the value is <code>no</code>, then if the completion table fails to match
the text at point, <code>completion-at-point</code> moves on to the
next function in <code>completion-at-point-functions</code> instead of
reporting a completion failure. 
</dd></dl>

        <p>A function in <code>completion-at-point-functions</code> may also return a
function.  In that case, that returned function is called, with no
argument, and it is entirely responsible for performing the
completion.  We discourage this usage; it is intended to help convert
old code to using <code>completion-at-point</code>.

        </p><p>The first function in <code>completion-at-point-functions</code> to return a
non-<code>nil</code> value is used by <code>completion-at-point</code>.  The
remaining functions are not called.  The exception to this is when
there is an <code>:exclusive</code> specification, as described above. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The following function provides a convenient way to perform
completion on an arbitrary stretch of text in an Emacs buffer:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/completion%2Din%2Dregion"></a><a name="DASH-508"></a>— Function: <b>completion-in-region</b><var> start end collection &amp;optional predicate<a name="index-completion_002din_002dregion-1236"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function completes the text in the current buffer between the
positions <var>start</var> and <var>end</var>, using <var>collection</var>.  The
argument <var>collection</var> has the same meaning as in
<code>try-completion</code> (see <a href="Basic-Completion.html#Basic-Completion">Basic Completion</a>).

        </p><p>This function inserts the completion text directly into the current
buffer.  Unlike <code>completing-read</code> (see <a href="Minibuffer-Completion.html#Minibuffer-Completion">Minibuffer Completion</a>), it does not activate the minibuffer.

        </p><p>For this function to work, point must be somewhere between <var>start</var>
and <var>end</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>
