<a name="index-asking-the-user-questions"></a>

<p>This section describes functions used to ask the user a yes-or-no
question.  The function <code>y-or-n-p</code> can be answered with a single
character; it is useful for questions where an inadvertent wrong answer
will not have serious consequences.  <code>yes-or-no-p</code> is suitable for
more momentous questions, since it requires three or four characters to
answer.
</p>
<p>If either of these functions is called in a command that was invoked
using the mouse—more precisely, if <code>last-nonmenu-event</code>
(see <a href="Command-Loop-Info.html#Command-Loop-Info">Command Loop Info</a>) is either <code>nil</code> or a list—then it
uses a dialog box or pop-up menu to ask the question.  Otherwise, it
uses keyboard input.  You can force use either of the mouse or of keyboard
input by binding <code>last-nonmenu-event</code> to a suitable value around
the call.
</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, <code>yes-or-no-p</code> uses the minibuffer and
<code>y-or-n-p</code> does not; but it seems best to describe them together.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/y%2Dor%2Dn%2Dp"></a><a name="index-y_002dor_002dn_002dp"></a>Function: <strong>y-or-n-p</strong> <em>prompt</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function asks the user a question, expecting input in the echo
area.  It returns <code>t</code> if the user types <kbd>y</kbd>, <code>nil</code> if the
user types <kbd>n</kbd>.  This function also accepts <tt class="key">SPC</tt> to mean yes
and <tt class="key">DEL</tt> to mean no.  It accepts <kbd>C-]</kbd> to quit, like
<kbd>C-g</kbd>, because the question might look like a minibuffer and for
that reason the user might try to use <kbd>C-]</kbd> to get out.  The answer
is a single character, with no <tt class="key">RET</tt> needed to terminate it.  Upper
and lower case are equivalent.
</p>
<p>“Asking the question” means printing <var>prompt</var> in the echo area,
followed by the string ‘<samp>(y&nbsp;or&nbsp;n)&nbsp;</samp>’<!-- /@w -->.  If the input is not one of
the expected answers (<kbd>y</kbd>, <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd><span class="key">SPC</span></kbd>,
<kbd><span class="key">DEL</span></kbd>, or something that quits), the function responds
‘<samp>Please answer y or n.</samp>’, and repeats the request.
</p>
<p>This function does not actually use the minibuffer, since it does not
allow editing of the answer.  It actually uses the echo area (see <a href="The-Echo-Area.html#The-Echo-Area">The Echo Area</a>), which uses the same screen space as the minibuffer.  The
cursor moves to the echo area while the question is being asked.
</p>
<p>The answers and their meanings, even ‘<samp>y</samp>’ and ‘<samp>n</samp>’, are not
hardwired, and are specified by the keymap <code>query-replace-map</code>
(see <a href="Search-and-Replace.html#Search-and-Replace">Search and Replace</a>).  In particular, if the user enters the
special responses <code>recenter</code>, <code>scroll-up</code>,
<code>scroll-down</code>, <code>scroll-other-window</code>, or
<code>scroll-other-window-down</code> (respectively bound to <kbd>C-l</kbd>,
<kbd>C-v</kbd>, <kbd>M-v</kbd>, <kbd>C-M-v</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-S-v</kbd> in
<code>query-replace-map</code>), this function performs the specified window
recentering or scrolling operation, and poses the question again.
</p>
<p>We show successive lines of echo area messages, but only one actually
appears on the screen at a time.

<dd><p>Like <code>y-or-n-p</code>, except that if the user fails to answer within
<var>seconds</var> seconds, this function stops waiting and returns
<var>default</var>.  It works by setting up a timer; see <a href="Timers.html#Timers">Timers</a>.
The argument <var>seconds</var> should be a number.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/yes%2Dor%2Dno%2Dp"></a><a name="index-yes_002dor_002dno_002dp"></a>Function: <strong>yes-or-no-p</strong> <em>prompt</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function asks the user a question, expecting input in the
minibuffer.  It returns <code>t</code> if the user enters ‘<samp>yes</samp>’,
<code>nil</code> if the user types ‘<samp>no</samp>’.  The user must type <tt class="key">RET</tt> to
finalize the response.  Upper and lower case are equivalent.
</p>
<p><code>yes-or-no-p</code> starts by displaying <var>prompt</var> in the echo area,
followed by ‘<samp>(yes&nbsp;or&nbsp;no)&nbsp;</samp>’<!-- /@w -->.  The user must type one of the
expected responses; otherwise, the function responds ‘<samp>Please answer
yes or no.</samp>’, waits about two seconds and repeats the request.
</p>
<p><code>yes-or-no-p</code> requires more work from the user than
<code>y-or-n-p</code> and is appropriate for more crucial decisions.
</p>
<p>Here is an example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">(yes-or-no-p "Do you really want to remove everything? ")

;; <span class="roman">After evaluation of the preceding expression,</span>
;;   <span class="roman">the following prompt appears,</span>
;;   <span class="roman">with an empty minibuffer:</span>
</pre><pre class="smallexample">
</pre><pre class="smallexample">---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
Do you really want to remove everything? (yes or no)
---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
</pre></div>

<p>If the user first types <kbd>y <span class="key">RET</span></kbd>, which is invalid because this
function demands the entire word ‘<samp>yes</samp>’, it responds by displaying
these prompts, with a brief pause between them:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
Please answer yes or no.
Do you really want to remove everything? (yes or no)
---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>
