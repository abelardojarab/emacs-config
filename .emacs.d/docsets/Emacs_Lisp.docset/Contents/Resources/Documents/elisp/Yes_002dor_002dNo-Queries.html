<h3 class="section">19.7 Yes-or-No Queries</h3>

<p><a name="index-asking-the-user-questions-1237"></a><a name="index-querying-the-user-1238"></a><a name="index-yes_002dor_002dno-questions-1239"></a>
  This section describes functions used to ask the user a yes-or-no
question.  The function <code>y-or-n-p</code> can be answered with a single
character; it is useful for questions where an inadvertent wrong answer
will not have serious consequences.  <code>yes-or-no-p</code> is suitable for
more momentous questions, since it requires three or four characters to
answer.

   </p><p>If either of these functions is called in a command that was invoked
using the mouse—more precisely, if <code>last-nonmenu-event</code>
(see <a href="Command-Loop-Info.html#Command-Loop-Info">Command Loop Info</a>) is either <code>nil</code> or a list—then it
uses a dialog box or pop-up menu to ask the question.  Otherwise, it
uses keyboard input.  You can force use either of the mouse or of keyboard
input by binding <code>last-nonmenu-event</code> to a suitable value around
the call.

   </p><p>Strictly speaking, <code>yes-or-no-p</code> uses the minibuffer and
<code>y-or-n-p</code> does not; but it seems best to describe them together.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/y%2Dor%2Dn%2Dp"></a><a name="DASH-2403"></a>— Function: <b>y-or-n-p</b><var> prompt<a name="index-y_002dor_002dn_002dp-1240"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function asks the user a question, expecting input in the echo
area.  It returns <code>t</code> if the user types <kbd>y</kbd>, <code>nil</code> if the
user types <kbd>n</kbd>.  This function also accepts &lt;SPC&gt; to mean yes
and &lt;DEL&gt; to mean no.  It accepts <kbd>C-]</kbd> to mean “quit”, like
<kbd>C-g</kbd>, because the question might look like a minibuffer and for
that reason the user might try to use <kbd>C-]</kbd> to get out.  The answer
is a single character, with no &lt;RET&gt; needed to terminate it.  Upper
and lower case are equivalent.

        </p><p>“Asking the question” means printing <var>prompt</var> in the echo area,
followed by the string ‘<samp><span class="samp">(y&nbsp;or&nbsp;n)&nbsp;</span></samp>’<!-- /@w -->.  If the input is not one of
the expected answers (<kbd>y</kbd>, <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>,
<kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>, or something that quits), the function responds
‘<samp><span class="samp">Please answer y or n.</span></samp>’, and repeats the request.

        </p><p>This function does not actually use the minibuffer, since it does not
allow editing of the answer.  It actually uses the echo area (see <a href="The-Echo-Area.html#The-Echo-Area">The Echo Area</a>), which uses the same screen space as the minibuffer.  The
cursor moves to the echo area while the question is being asked.

        </p><p>The answers and their meanings, even ‘<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>’ and ‘<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>’, are not
hardwired, and are specified by the keymap <code>query-replace-map</code>
(see <a href="Search-and-Replace.html#Search-and-Replace">Search and Replace</a>).  In particular, if the user enters the
special responses <code>recenter</code>, <code>scroll-up</code>,
<code>scroll-down</code>, <code>scroll-other-window</code>, or
<code>scroll-other-window-down</code> (respectively bound to <kbd>C-l</kbd>,
<kbd>C-v</kbd>, <kbd>M-v</kbd>, <kbd>C-M-v</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-S-v</kbd> in
<code>query-replace-map</code>), this function performs the specified window
recentering or scrolling operation, and poses the question again.

     </p><p class="noindent">We show successive lines of echo area messages, but only one actually
appears on the screen at a time. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/y%2Dor%2Dn%2Dp%2Dwith%2Dtimeout"></a><a name="DASH-2404"></a>— Function: <b>y-or-n-p-with-timeout</b><var> prompt seconds default<a name="index-y_002dor_002dn_002dp_002dwith_002dtimeout-1241"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Like <code>y-or-n-p</code>, except that if the user fails to answer within
<var>seconds</var> seconds, this function stops waiting and returns
<var>default</var>.  It works by setting up a timer; see <a href="Timers.html#Timers">Timers</a>. 
The argument <var>seconds</var> should be a number. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/yes%2Dor%2Dno%2Dp"></a><a name="DASH-2405"></a>— Function: <b>yes-or-no-p</b><var> prompt<a name="index-yes_002dor_002dno_002dp-1242"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function asks the user a question, expecting input in the
minibuffer.  It returns <code>t</code> if the user enters ‘<samp><span class="samp">yes</span></samp>’,
<code>nil</code> if the user types ‘<samp><span class="samp">no</span></samp>’.  The user must type &lt;RET&gt; to
finalize the response.  Upper and lower case are equivalent.

        </p><p><code>yes-or-no-p</code> starts by displaying <var>prompt</var> in the echo area,
followed by ‘<samp><span class="samp">(yes&nbsp;or&nbsp;no)&nbsp;</span></samp>’<!-- /@w -->.  The user must type one of the
expected responses; otherwise, the function responds ‘<samp><span class="samp">Please answer
yes or no.</span></samp>’, waits about two seconds and repeats the request.

        </p><p><code>yes-or-no-p</code> requires more work from the user than
<code>y-or-n-p</code> and is appropriate for more crucial decisions.

        </p><p>Here is an example:

     </p><pre class="smallexample">          (yes-or-no-p "Do you really want to remove everything? ")
          
          ;; <span class="roman">After evaluation of the preceding expression,</span>
          ;;   <span class="roman">the following prompt appears,</span>
          ;;   <span class="roman">with an empty minibuffer:</span>
          
          ---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
          Do you really want to remove everything? (yes or no)
          ---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">If the user first types <kbd>y &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, which is invalid because this
function demands the entire word ‘<samp><span class="samp">yes</span></samp>’, it responds by displaying
these prompts, with a brief pause between them:

     </p><pre class="smallexample">          ---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
          Please answer yes or no.
          Do you really want to remove everything? (yes or no)
          ---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
