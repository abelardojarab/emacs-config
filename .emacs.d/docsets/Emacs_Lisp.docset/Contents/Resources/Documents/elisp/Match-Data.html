<h3 class="section">33.6 The Match Data</h3>

<p><a name="index-match-data-3431"></a>
  Emacs keeps track of the start and end positions of the segments of
text found during a search; this is called the <dfn>match data</dfn>. 
Thanks to the match data, you can search for a complex pattern, such
as a date in a mail message, and then extract parts of the match under
control of the pattern.

   <p>Because the match data normally describe the most recent search only,
you must be careful not to do another search inadvertently between the
search you wish to refer back to and the use of the match data.  If you
can't avoid another intervening search, you must save and restore the
match data around it, to prevent it from being overwritten.

   <p>Notice that all functions are allowed to overwrite the match data
unless they're explicitly documented not to do so.  A consequence is
that functions that are run implicitly in the background
(see <a href="Timers.html#Timers">Timers</a>, and <a href="Idle-Timers.html#Idle-Timers">Idle Timers</a>) should likely save and restore
the match data explicitly.
