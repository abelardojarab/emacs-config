<h4 class="subsection">22.3.2 Keymaps and Minor Modes</h4>

<p>Each minor mode can have its own keymap, which is active when the mode
is enabled.  To set up a keymap for a minor mode, add an element to the
alist <code>minor-mode-map-alist</code>.  See <a href="Controlling-Active-Maps.html#Definition-of-minor_002dmode_002dmap_002dalist">Definition of minor-mode-map-alist</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-self_002dinsert_002dcommand_002c-minor-modes"></a>
<p>One use of minor mode keymaps is to modify the behavior of certain
self-inserting characters so that they do something else as well as
self-insert.  (Another way to customize <code>self-insert-command</code> is
through <code>post-self-insert-hook</code>.  Apart from this, the facilities
for customizing <code>self-insert-command</code> are limited to special cases,
designed for abbrevs and Auto Fill mode.  Do not try substituting your
own definition of <code>self-insert-command</code> for the standard one.  The
editor command loop handles this function specially.)
</p>
<p>Minor modes may bind commands to key sequences consisting of <kbd>C-c</kbd>
followed by a punctuation character.  However, sequences consisting of
<kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by one of <kbd>{}&lt;&gt;:;</kbd>, or a control character or
digit, are reserved for major modes.  Also, <kbd>C-c <var>letter</var></kbd> is
reserved for users.  See <a href="Key-Binding-Conventions.html#Key-Binding-Conventions">Key Binding Conventions</a>.
