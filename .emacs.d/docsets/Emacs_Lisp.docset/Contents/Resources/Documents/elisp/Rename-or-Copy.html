<h4 class="subsection">25.1.2 Backup by Renaming or by Copying?</h4>
<a name="index-backup-files_002c-rename-or-copy"></a>

<p>There are two ways that Emacs can make a backup file:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Emacs can rename the original file so that it becomes a backup file, and
then write the buffer being saved into a new file.  After this
procedure, any other names (i.e., hard links) of the original file now
refer to the backup file.  The new file is owned by the user doing the
editing, and its group is the default for new files written by the user
in that directory.

</li><li> Emacs can copy the original file into a backup file, and then overwrite
the original file with new contents.  After this procedure, any other
names (i.e., hard links) of the original file continue to refer to the
current (updated) version of the file.  The file’s owner and group will
be unchanged.
</li></ul>

<p>The first method, renaming, is the default.
</p>
<p>The variable <code>backup-by-copying</code>, if non-<code>nil</code>, says to use
the second method, which is to copy the original file and overwrite it
with the new buffer contents.  The variable <code>file-precious-flag</code>,
if non-<code>nil</code>, also has this effect (as a sideline of its main
significance).  See <a href="Saving-Buffers.html#Saving-Buffers">Saving Buffers</a>.

<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/backup%2Dby%2Dcopying"></a><a name="index-backup_002dby_002dcopying"></a>User Option: <strong>backup-by-copying</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs always makes backup files by
copying.  The default is <code>nil</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The following three variables, when non-<code>nil</code>, cause the second
method to be used in certain special cases.  They have no effect on the
treatment of files that don’t fall into the special cases.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/backup%2Dby%2Dcopying%2Dwhen%2Dlinked"></a><a name="index-backup_002dby_002dcopying_002dwhen_002dlinked"></a>User Option: <strong>backup-by-copying-when-linked</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs makes backups by copying for
files with multiple names (hard links).  The default is <code>nil</code>.
</p>
<p>This variable is significant only if <code>backup-by-copying</code> is
<code>nil</code>, since copying is always used when that variable is
non-<code>nil</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/backup%2Dby%2Dcopying%2Dwhen%2Dmismatch"></a><a name="index-backup_002dby_002dcopying_002dwhen_002dmismatch"></a>User Option: <strong>backup-by-copying-when-mismatch</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code> (the default), Emacs makes backups
by copying in cases where renaming would change either the owner or
the group of the file.
</p>
<p>The value has no effect when renaming would not alter the owner or
group of the file; that is, for files which are owned by the user and
whose group matches the default for a new file created there by the
user.
</p>
<p>This variable is significant only if <code>backup-by-copying</code> is
<code>nil</code>, since copying is always used when that variable is
non-<code>nil</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/backup%2Dby%2Dcopying%2Dwhen%2Dprivileged%2Dmismatch"></a><a name="index-backup_002dby_002dcopying_002dwhen_002dprivileged_002dmismatch"></a>User Option: <strong>backup-by-copying-when-privileged-mismatch</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable, if non-<code>nil</code>, specifies the same behavior as
<code>backup-by-copying-when-mismatch</code>, but only for certain user-id
values: namely, those less than or equal to a certain number.  You set
this variable to that number.
</p>
<p>Thus, if you set <code>backup-by-copying-when-privileged-mismatch</code>
to 0, backup by copying is done for the superuser only,
when necessary to prevent a change in the owner of the file.
</p>
<p>The default is 200.
</p></dd></dl>
