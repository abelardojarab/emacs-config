<h3 class="section">20.9 Special Events</h3>

<p><a name="index-special-events-1461"></a>Certain <dfn>special events</dfn> are handled at a very low level&mdash;as soon
as they are read.  The <code>read-event</code> function processes these
events itself, and never returns them.  Instead, it keeps waiting for
the first event that is not special and returns that one.

   <p>Special events do not echo, they are never grouped into key
sequences, and they never appear in the value of
<code>last-command-event</code> or <code>(this-command-keys)</code>.  They do not
discard a numeric argument, they cannot be unread with
<code>unread-command-events</code>, they may not appear in a keyboard macro,
and they are not recorded in a keyboard macro while you are defining
one.

   <p>Special events do, however, appear in <code>last-input-event</code>
immediately after they are read, and this is the way for the event's
definition to find the actual event.

   <p>The events types <code>iconify-frame</code>, <code>make-frame-visible</code>,
<code>delete-frame</code>, <code>drag-n-drop</code>, <code>language-change</code>, and
user signals like <code>sigusr1</code> are normally handled in this way. 
The keymap which defines how to handle special events&mdash;and which
events are special&mdash;is in the variable <code>special-event-map</code>
(see <a href="Active-Keymaps.html#Active-Keymaps">Active Keymaps</a>).
