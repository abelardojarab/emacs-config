<h5 class="subsubsection">10.5.3.2 How Emacs Processes Errors</h5>

<p>When an error is signaled, <code>signal</code> searches for an active
<dfn>handler</dfn> for the error.  A handler is a sequence of Lisp
expressions designated to be executed if an error happens in part of the
Lisp program.  If the error has an applicable handler, the handler is
executed, and control resumes following the handler.  The handler
executes in the environment of the <code>condition-case</code> that
established it; all functions called within that <code>condition-case</code>
have already been exited, and the handler cannot return to them.

   </p><p>If there is no applicable handler for the error, it terminates the
current command and returns control to the editor command loop.  (The
command loop has an implicit handler for all kinds of errors.)  The
command loop's handler uses the error symbol and associated data to
print an error message.  You can use the variable
<code>command-error-function</code> to control how this is done:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/command%2Derror%2Dfunction"></a><a name="DASH-1639"></a>â€” Variable: <b>command-error-function</b><var><a name="index-command_002derror_002dfunction-591"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable, if non-<code>nil</code>, specifies a function to use to
handle errors that return control to the Emacs command loop.  The
function should take three arguments: <var>data</var>, a list of the same
form that <code>condition-case</code> would bind to its variable;
<var>context</var>, a string describing the situation in which the error
occurred, or (more often) <code>nil</code>; and <var>caller</var>, the Lisp
function which called the primitive that signaled the error. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdebug_002don_002derror_007d-use-592"></a>An error that has no explicit handler may call the Lisp debugger.  The
debugger is enabled if the variable <code>debug-on-error</code> (see <a href="Error-Debugging.html#Error-Debugging">Error Debugging</a>) is non-<code>nil</code>.  Unlike error handlers, the debugger runs
in the environment of the error, so that you can examine values of
variables precisely as they were at the time of the error.
