  <dfn>Narrowing</dfn> means limiting the text addressable by Emacs editing
commands to a limited range of characters in a buffer.  The text that
remains addressable is called the <dfn>accessible portion</dfn> of the
buffer.

   </p><p>Narrowing is specified with two buffer positions, which become the
beginning and end of the accessible portion.  For most editing
commands and primitives, these positions replace the values of the
beginning and end of the buffer.  While narrowing is in effect, no
text outside the accessible portion is displayed, and point cannot
move outside the accessible portion.  Note that narrowing does not
alter actual buffer positions (see <a href="Point.html#Point">Point</a>); it only determines
which positions are considered the accessible portion of the buffer. 
Most functions refuse to operate on text that is outside the
accessible portion.

   </p><p>Commands for saving buffers are unaffected by narrowing; they save
the entire buffer regardless of any narrowing.

   </p><p>If you need to display in a single buffer several very different
types of text, consider using an alternative facility described in
<a href="Swapping-Text.html#Swapping-Text">Swapping Text</a>.

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/narrow%2Dto%2Dregion"></a><a name="DASH-1474"></a>— Command: <b>narrow-to-region</b><var> start end<a name="index-narrow_002dto_002dregion-2824"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sets the accessible portion of the current buffer to start
at <var>start</var> and end at <var>end</var>.  Both arguments should be character
positions.

        </p><p>In an interactive call, <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> are set to the bounds
of the current region (point and the mark, with the smallest first). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/narrow%2Dto%2Dpage"></a><a name="DASH-1475"></a>— Command: <b>narrow-to-page</b><var> &amp;optional move-count<a name="index-narrow_002dto_002dpage-2825"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sets the accessible portion of the current buffer to
include just the current page.  An optional first argument
<var>move-count</var> non-<code>nil</code> means to move forward or backward by
<var>move-count</var> pages and then narrow to one page.  The variable
<code>page-delimiter</code> specifies where pages start and end
(see <a href="Standard-Regexps.html#Standard-Regexps">Standard Regexps</a>).

        </p><p>In an interactive call, <var>move-count</var> is set to the numeric prefix
argument.

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/widen"></a><a name="DASH-1476"></a>— Command: <b>widen</b><var><a name="index-widen-2826"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-widening-2827"></a>This function cancels any narrowing in the current buffer, so that the
entire contents are accessible.  This is called <dfn>widening</dfn>. 
It is equivalent to the following expression:

     </p><pre class="example">          (narrow-to-region 1 (1+ (buffer-size)))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/buffer%2Dnarrowed%2Dp"></a><a name="DASH-1477"></a>— Function: <b>buffer-narrowed-p</b><var><a name="index-buffer_002dnarrowed_002dp-2828"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns non-<code>nil</code> if the buffer is narrowed, and
<code>nil</code> otherwise. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/save%2Drestriction"></a><a name="DASH-1478"></a>— Special Form: <b>save-restriction</b><var> body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-save_002drestriction-2829"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form saves the current bounds of the accessible portion,
evaluates the <var>body</var> forms, and finally restores the saved bounds,
thus restoring the same state of narrowing (or absence thereof) formerly
in effect.  The state of narrowing is restored even in the event of an
abnormal exit via <code>throw</code> or error (see <a href="Nonlocal-Exits.html#Nonlocal-Exits">Nonlocal Exits</a>). 
Therefore, this construct is a clean way to narrow a buffer temporarily.

        </p><p>The value returned by <code>save-restriction</code> is that returned by the
last form in <var>body</var>, or <code>nil</code> if no body forms were given.

     <!-- Wordy to avoid overfull hbox.  -rjc 16mar92 -->
        </p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> it is easy to make a mistake when using the
<code>save-restriction</code> construct.  Read the entire description here
before you try it.

        </p><p>If <var>body</var> changes the current buffer, <code>save-restriction</code> still
restores the restrictions on the original buffer (the buffer whose
restrictions it saved from), but it does not restore the identity of the
current buffer.

        </p><p><code>save-restriction</code> does <em>not</em> restore point and the mark; use
<code>save-excursion</code> for that.  If you use both <code>save-restriction</code>
and <code>save-excursion</code> together, <code>save-excursion</code> should come
first (on the outside).  Otherwise, the old point value would be
restored with temporary narrowing still in effect.  If the old point
value were outside the limits of the temporary narrowing, this would
fail to restore it accurately.

        </p><p>Here is a simple example of correct use of <code>save-restriction</code>:

     </p><pre class="example">          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          This is the contents of foo
          This is the contents of foo
          This is the contents of foo-!-
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (save-excursion
            (save-restriction
              (goto-char 1)
              (forward-line 2)
              (narrow-to-region 1 (point))
              (goto-char (point-min))
              (replace-string "foo" "bar")))
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          This is the contents of bar
          This is the contents of bar
          This is the contents of foo-!-
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
</pre>
