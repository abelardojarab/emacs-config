<p><a name="index-overlays-3802"></a><!-- FIXME: mention intervals in this section? -->

   <p>You can use <dfn>overlays</dfn> to alter the appearance of a buffer's text on
the screen, for the sake of presentation features.  An overlay is an
object that belongs to a particular buffer, and has a specified
beginning and end.  It also has properties that you can examine and set;
these affect the display of the text within the overlay.

   <p><a name="index-scalability-of-overlays-3803"></a>The visual effect of an overlay is the same as of the corresponding
text property (see <a href="Text-Properties.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>).  However, due to a different
implementation, overlays generally don't scale well (many operations
take a time that is proportional to the number of overlays in the
buffer).  If you need to affect the visual appearance of many portions
in the buffer, we recommend using text properties.

   <p>An overlay uses markers to record its beginning and end; thus,
editing the text of the buffer adjusts the beginning and end of each
overlay so that it stays with the text.  When you create the overlay,
you can specify whether text inserted at the beginning should be
inside the overlay or outside, and likewise for the end of the overlay.
