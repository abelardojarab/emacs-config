<h4 class="subsection">13.5.1 Wrong Time</h4>

<p>The most common problem in writing macros is doing some of the
real work prematurely&mdash;while expanding the macro, rather than in the
expansion itself.  For instance, one real package had this macro
definition:

<pre class="example">     (defmacro my-set-buffer-multibyte (arg)
       (if (fboundp 'set-buffer-multibyte)
           (set-buffer-multibyte arg)))
</pre>
   <p>With this erroneous macro definition, the program worked fine when
interpreted but failed when compiled.  This macro definition called
<code>set-buffer-multibyte</code> during compilation, which was wrong, and
then did nothing when the compiled package was run.  The definition
that the programmer really wanted was this:

<pre class="example">     (defmacro my-set-buffer-multibyte (arg)
       (if (fboundp 'set-buffer-multibyte)
           `(set-buffer-multibyte ,arg)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This macro expands, if appropriate, into a call to
<code>set-buffer-multibyte</code> that will be executed when the compiled
program is actually run.
