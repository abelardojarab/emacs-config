<h4 class="subsection">2.3.7 Array Type</h4>

<p>An <em>array</em> is composed of an arbitrary number of slots for
holding or referring to other Lisp objects, arranged in a contiguous block of
memory.  Accessing any element of an array takes approximately the same
amount of time.  In contrast, accessing an element of a list requires
time proportional to the position of the element in the list.  (Elements
at the end of a list take longer to access than elements at the
beginning of a list.)
</p>
<p>Emacs defines four types of array: strings, vectors, bool-vectors, and
char-tables.
</p>
<p>A string is an array of characters and a vector is an array of
arbitrary objects.  A bool-vector can hold only <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code>.
These kinds of array may have any length up to the largest integer.
Char-tables are sparse arrays indexed by any valid character code; they
can hold arbitrary objects.
</p>
<p>The first element of an array has index zero, the second element has
index 1, and so on.  This is called <em>zero-origin</em> indexing.  For
example, an array of four elements has indices 0, 1, 2, and&nbsp;3<!-- /@w -->.  The
largest possible index value is one less than the length of the array.
Once an array is created, its length is fixed.
</p>
<p>All Emacs Lisp arrays are one-dimensional.  (Most other programming
languages support multidimensional arrays, but they are not essential;
you can get the same effect with nested one-dimensional arrays.)  Each
type of array has its own read syntax; see the following sections for
details.
</p>
<p>The array type is a subset of the sequence type, and contains the
string type, the vector type, the bool-vector type, and the char-table
type.
