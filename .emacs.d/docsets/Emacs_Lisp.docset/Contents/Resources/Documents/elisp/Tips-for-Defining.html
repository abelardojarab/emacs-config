<h3 class="section">11.6 Tips for Defining Variables Robustly</h3>

<p>When you define a variable whose value is a function, or a list of
functions, use a name that ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-function</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-functions</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively.

   <p>There are several other variable name conventions;
here is a complete list:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...-hook</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The variable is a normal hook (see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...-function</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The value is a function.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...-functions</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The value is a list of functions.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...-form</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The value is a form (an expression).

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...-forms</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The value is a list of forms (expressions).

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...-predicate</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The value is a predicate&mdash;a function of one argument that returns
non-<code>nil</code> for &ldquo;good&rdquo; arguments and <code>nil</code> for &ldquo;bad&rdquo;
arguments.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...-flag</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The value is significant only as to whether it is <code>nil</code> or not. 
Since such variables often end up acquiring more values over time,
this convention is not strongly recommended.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...-program</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The value is a program name.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...-command</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The value is a whole shell command.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...-switches</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The value specifies options for a command. 
</dl>

   <p>When you define a variable, always consider whether you should mark
it as &ldquo;safe&rdquo; or &ldquo;risky&rdquo;; see <a href="File-Local-Variables.html#File-Local-Variables">File Local Variables</a>.

   <p>When defining and initializing a variable that holds a complicated
value (such as a keymap with bindings in it), it's best to put the
entire computation of the value into the <code>defvar</code>, like this:

<pre class="example">     (defvar my-mode-map
       (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
         (define-key map "\C-c\C-a" 'my-command)
         ...
         map)
       <var>docstring</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This method has several benefits.  First, if the user quits while
loading the file, the variable is either still uninitialized or
initialized properly, never in-between.  If it is still uninitialized,
reloading the file will initialize it properly.  Second, reloading the
file once the variable is initialized will not alter it; that is
important if the user has run hooks to alter part of the contents
(such as, to rebind keys).  Third, evaluating the <code>defvar</code> form
with <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> will reinitialize the map completely.

   <p>Putting so much code in the <code>defvar</code> form has one disadvantage:
it puts the documentation string far away from the line which names the
variable.  Here's a safe way to avoid that:

<pre class="example">     (defvar my-mode-map nil
       <var>docstring</var>)
     (unless my-mode-map
       (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
         (define-key map "\C-c\C-a" 'my-command)
         ...
         (setq my-mode-map map)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This has all the same advantages as putting the initialization inside
the <code>defvar</code>, except that you must type <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> twice, once on
each form, if you do want to reinitialize the variable.
