<h3 class="section">20.1 Command Loop Overview</h3>

<p>The first thing the command loop must do is read a key sequence,
which is a sequence of input events that translates into a command. 
It does this by calling the function <code>read-key-sequence</code>.  Lisp
programs can also call this function (see <a href="Key-Sequence-Input.html#Key-Sequence-Input">Key Sequence Input</a>). 
They can also read input at a lower level with <code>read-key</code> or
<code>read-event</code> (see <a href="Reading-One-Event.html#Reading-One-Event">Reading One Event</a>), or discard pending
input with <code>discard-input</code> (see <a href="Event-Input-Misc.html#Event-Input-Misc">Event Input Misc</a>).

   </p><p>The key sequence is translated into a command through the currently
active keymaps.  See <a href="Key-Lookup.html#Key-Lookup">Key Lookup</a>, for information on how this is done. 
The result should be a keyboard macro or an interactively callable
function.  If the key is <kbd>M-x</kbd>, then it reads the name of another
command, which it then calls.  This is done by the command
<code>execute-extended-command</code> (see <a href="Interactive-Call.html#Interactive-Call">Interactive Call</a>).

   </p><p>Prior to executing the command, Emacs runs <code>undo-boundary</code> to
create an undo boundary.  See <a href="Maintaining-Undo.html#Maintaining-Undo">Maintaining Undo</a>.

   </p><p>To execute a command, Emacs first reads its arguments by calling
<code>command-execute</code> (see <a href="Interactive-Call.html#Interactive-Call">Interactive Call</a>).  For commands
written in Lisp, the <code>interactive</code> specification says how to read
the arguments.  This may use the prefix argument (see <a href="Prefix-Command-Arguments.html#Prefix-Command-Arguments">Prefix Command Arguments</a>) or may read with prompting in the minibuffer
(see <a href="Minibuffers.html#Minibuffers">Minibuffers</a>).  For example, the command <code>find-file</code> has
an <code>interactive</code> specification which says to read a file name
using the minibuffer.  The function body of <code>find-file</code> does not
use the minibuffer, so if you call <code>find-file</code> as a function from
Lisp code, you must supply the file name string as an ordinary Lisp
function argument.

   </p><p>If the command is a keyboard macro (i.e., a string or vector),
Emacs executes it using <code>execute-kbd-macro</code> (see <a href="Keyboard-Macros.html#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>).

<blockquote><p>This normal hook is run by the editor command loop before it executes
each command.  At that time, <code>this-command</code> contains the command
that is about to run, and <code>last-command</code> describes the previous
command.  See <a href="Command-Loop-Info.html#Command-Loop-Info">Command Loop Info</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/post%2Dcommand%2Dhook"></a><a name="DASH-465"></a>— Variable: <b>post-command-hook</b><var><a name="index-post_002dcommand_002dhook-1282"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This normal hook is run by the editor command loop after it executes
each command (including commands terminated prematurely by quitting or
by errors).  At that time, <code>this-command</code> refers to the command
that just ran, and <code>last-command</code> refers to the command before
that.

        </p><p>This hook is also run when Emacs first enters the command loop (at
which point <code>this-command</code> and <code>last-command</code> are both
<code>nil</code>). 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Quitting is suppressed while running <code>pre-command-hook</code> and
<code>post-command-hook</code>.  If an error happens while executing one of
these hooks, it does not terminate execution of the hook; instead
the error is silenced and the function in which the error occurred
is removed from the hook.

   </p><p>A request coming into the Emacs server (see <a href="../emacs/Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>) runs these two hooks just as a keyboard
command does.
