<h4 class="subsection">2.3.15 Primitive Function Type</h4>

<p><a name="index-primitive-function-111"></a>
  A <dfn>primitive function</dfn> is a function callable from Lisp but
written in the C programming language.  Primitive functions are also
called <dfn>subrs</dfn> or <dfn>built-in functions</dfn>.  (The word &ldquo;subr&rdquo; is
derived from &ldquo;subroutine&rdquo;.)  Most primitive functions evaluate all
their arguments when they are called.  A primitive function that does
not evaluate all its arguments is called a <dfn>special form</dfn>
(see <a href="Special-Forms.html#Special-Forms">Special Forms</a>).

   <p>It does not matter to the caller of a function whether the function is
primitive.  However, this does matter if you try to redefine a primitive
with a function written in Lisp.  The reason is that the primitive
function may be called directly from C code.  Calls to the redefined
function from Lisp will use the new definition, but calls from C code
may still use the built-in definition.  Therefore, <strong>we discourage
redefinition of primitive functions</strong>.

   <p>The term <dfn>function</dfn> refers to all Emacs functions, whether written
in Lisp or C.  See <a href="Function-Type.html#Function-Type">Function Type</a>, for information about the
functions written in Lisp.

   <p>Primitive functions have no read syntax and print in hash notation
with the name of the subroutine.

<pre class="example">     (symbol-function 'car)          ; <span class="roman">Access the function cell</span>
                                     ;   <span class="roman">of the symbol.</span>
          &rArr; #&lt;subr car&gt;
     (subrp (symbol-function 'car))  ; <span class="roman">Is this a primitive function?</span>
          &rArr; t                       ; <span class="roman">Yes.</span>
</pre>
