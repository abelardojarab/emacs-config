<h4 class="subsection">37.21.1 Usual Display Conventions</h4>

<p>Here are the conventions for displaying each character code (in the
absence of a display table, which can override these
conventions; see <a href="Display-Tables.html#Display-Tables">Display Tables</a>).

   </p><p><a name="index-printable-ASCII-characters-4117"></a>
     </p><ul>
<li>The <dfn>printable <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters</dfn>, character codes 32
through 126 (consisting of numerals, English letters, and symbols like
‘<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>’) are displayed literally.

     </li><li>The tab character (character code 9) displays as whitespace stretching
up to the next tab stop column.  See <a href="../emacs/Text-Display.html#Text-Display">Text Display</a>.  The variable <code>tab-width</code> controls the number of
spaces per tab stop (see below).

     </li><li>The newline character (character code 10) has a special effect: it
ends the preceding line and starts a new line.

     <p><a name="index-ASCII-control-characters-4118"></a></p></li><li>The non-printable <dfn><acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters</dfn>—character
codes 0 through 31, as well as the &lt;DEL&gt; character (character code
127)—display in one of two ways according to the variable
<code>ctl-arrow</code>.  If this variable is non-<code>nil</code> (the default),
these characters are displayed as sequences of two glyphs, where the
first glyph is ‘<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>’ (a display table can specify a glyph to use
instead of ‘<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>’); e.g., the &lt;DEL&gt; character is displayed as
‘<samp><span class="samp">^?</span></samp>’.

     <p>If <code>ctl-arrow</code> is <code>nil</code>, these characters are displayed as
octal escapes (see below).

     </p><p>This rule also applies to carriage return (character code 13), if that
character appears in the buffer.  But carriage returns usually do not
appear in buffer text; they are eliminated as part of end-of-line
conversion (see <a href="Coding-System-Basics.html#Coding-System-Basics">Coding System Basics</a>).

     </p><p><a name="index-octal-escapes-4119"></a></p></li><li><dfn>Raw bytes</dfn> are non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters with codes 128
through 255 (see <a href="Text-Representations.html#Text-Representations">Text Representations</a>).  These characters display
as <dfn>octal escapes</dfn>: sequences of four glyphs, where the first
glyph is the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> code for ‘<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>’, and the others are
digit characters representing the character code in octal.  (A display
table can specify a glyph to use instead of ‘<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>’.)

     </li><li>Each non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character with code above 255 is displayed
literally, if the terminal supports it.  If the terminal does not
support it, the character is said to be <dfn>glyphless</dfn>, and it is
usually displayed using a placeholder glyph.  For example, if a
graphical terminal has no font for a character, Emacs usually displays
a box containing the character code in hexadecimal.  See <a href="Glyphless-Chars.html#Glyphless-Chars">Glyphless Chars</a>. 
</li></ul>

   <p>The above display conventions apply even when there is a display
table, for any character whose entry in the active display table is
<code>nil</code>.  Thus, when you set up a display table, you need only
specify the characters for which you want special behavior.

   </p><p>The following variables affect how certain characters are displayed
on the screen.  Since they change the number of columns the characters
occupy, they also affect the indentation functions.  They also affect
how the mode line is displayed; if you want to force redisplay of the
mode line using the new values, call the function
<code>force-mode-line-update</code> (see <a href="Mode-Line-Format.html#Mode-Line-Format">Mode Line Format</a>).

<blockquote><p><a name="index-control-characters-in-display-4121"></a>This buffer-local variable controls how control characters are
displayed.  If it is non-<code>nil</code>, they are displayed as a caret
followed by the character: ‘<samp><span class="samp">^A</span></samp>’.  If it is <code>nil</code>, they are
displayed as octal escapes: a backslash followed by three octal
digits, as in ‘<samp><span class="samp">\001</span></samp>’.

<blockquote><p>The value of this buffer-local variable is the spacing between tab
stops used for displaying tab characters in Emacs buffers.  The value
is in units of columns, and the default is 8.  Note that this feature
is completely independent of the user-settable tab stops used by the
command <code>tab-to-tab-stop</code>.  See <a href="Indent-Tabs.html#Indent-Tabs">Indent Tabs</a>.
