<h3 class="section">E.2 Pure Storage</h3>

<p><a name="index-pure-storage-4411"></a>
  Emacs Lisp uses two kinds of storage for user-created Lisp objects:
<dfn>normal storage</dfn> and <dfn>pure storage</dfn>.  Normal storage is where
all the new data created during an Emacs session are kept
(see <a href="Garbage-Collection.html#Garbage-Collection">Garbage Collection</a>).  Pure storage is used for certain data
in the preloaded standard Lisp files—data that should never change
during actual use of Emacs.

   </p><p>Pure storage is allocated only while <samp><span class="command">temacs</span></samp> is loading the
standard preloaded Lisp libraries.  In the file <samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp>, it is
marked as read-only (on operating systems that permit this), so that
the memory space can be shared by all the Emacs jobs running on the
machine at once.  Pure storage is not expandable; a fixed amount is
allocated when Emacs is compiled, and if that is not sufficient for
the preloaded libraries, <samp><span class="file">temacs</span></samp> allocates dynamic memory for
the part that didn't fit.  The resulting image will work, but garbage
collection (see <a href="Garbage-Collection.html#Garbage-Collection">Garbage Collection</a>) is disabled in this situation,
causing a memory leak.  Such an overflow normally won't happen unless
you try to preload additional libraries or add features to the
standard ones.  Emacs will display a warning about the overflow when
it starts.  If this happens, you should increase the compilation
parameter <code>SYSTEM_PURESIZE_EXTRA</code> in the file
<samp><span class="file">src/puresize.h</span></samp> and rebuild Emacs.

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/purecopy"></a><a name="DASH-1660"></a>— Function: <b>purecopy</b><var> object<a name="index-purecopy-4412"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes a copy in pure storage of <var>object</var>, and returns
it.  It copies a string by simply making a new string with the same
characters, but without text properties, in pure storage.  It
recursively copies the contents of vectors and cons cells.  It does
not make copies of other objects such as symbols, but just returns
them unchanged.  It signals an error if asked to copy markers.

        </p><p>This function is a no-op except while Emacs is being built and dumped;
it is usually called only in preloaded Lisp files. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is the number of bytes of pure storage
allocated so far.  Typically, in a dumped Emacs, this number is very
close to the total amount of pure storage available—if it were not,
we would preallocate less.

<blockquote><p>This variable determines whether <code>defun</code> should make a copy of the
function definition in pure storage.  If it is non-<code>nil</code>, then the
function definition is copied into pure storage.

        </p><p>This flag is <code>t</code> while loading all of the basic functions for
building Emacs initially (allowing those functions to be shareable and
non-collectible).  Dumping Emacs as an executable always writes
<code>nil</code> in this variable, regardless of the value it actually has
before and after dumping.

        </p><p>You should not change this flag in a running Emacs.
