<h4 class="subsection">20.8.1 Key Sequence Input</h4>

<p><a name="index-key-sequence-input-1416"></a>
  The command loop reads input a key sequence at a time, by calling
<code>read-key-sequence</code>.  Lisp programs can also call this function;
for example, <code>describe-key</code> uses it to read the key to describe.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/read%2Dkey%2Dsequence"></a><a name="DASH-1155"></a>— Function: <b>read-key-sequence</b><var> prompt &amp;optional continue-echo dont-downcase-last switch-frame-ok command-loop<a name="index-read_002dkey_002dsequence-1417"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function reads a key sequence and returns it as a string or
vector.  It keeps reading events until it has accumulated a complete key
sequence; that is, enough to specify a non-prefix command using the
currently active keymaps.  (Remember that a key sequence that starts
with a mouse event is read using the keymaps of the buffer in the
window that the mouse was in, not the current buffer.)

        </p><p>If the events are all characters and all can fit in a string, then
<code>read-key-sequence</code> returns a string (see <a href="Strings-of-Events.html#Strings-of-Events">Strings of Events</a>). 
Otherwise, it returns a vector, since a vector can hold all kinds of
events—characters, symbols, and lists.  The elements of the string or
vector are the events in the key sequence.

        </p><p>Reading a key sequence includes translating the events in various
ways.  See <a href="Translation-Keymaps.html#Translation-Keymaps">Translation Keymaps</a>.

        </p><p>The argument <var>prompt</var> is either a string to be displayed in the
echo area as a prompt, or <code>nil</code>, meaning not to display a prompt. 
The argument <var>continue-echo</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means to echo
this key as a continuation of the previous key.

        </p><p>Normally any upper case event is converted to lower case if the
original event is undefined and the lower case equivalent is defined. 
The argument <var>dont-downcase-last</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means do not
convert the last event to lower case.  This is appropriate for reading
a key sequence to be defined.

        </p><p>The argument <var>switch-frame-ok</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means that this
function should process a <code>switch-frame</code> event if the user
switches frames before typing anything.  If the user switches frames
in the middle of a key sequence, or at the start of the sequence but
<var>switch-frame-ok</var> is <code>nil</code>, then the event will be put off
until after the current key sequence.

        </p><p>The argument <var>command-loop</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means that this
key sequence is being read by something that will read commands one
after another.  It should be <code>nil</code> if the caller will read just
one key sequence.

        </p><p>In the following example, Emacs displays the prompt ‘<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>’ in the
echo area, and then the user types <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.

     </p><pre class="example">          (read-key-sequence "?")
          
          ---------- Echo Area ----------
          ?<kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>
          ---------- Echo Area ----------
          
               ⇒ "^X^F"
</pre>
        <p>The function <code>read-key-sequence</code> suppresses quitting: <kbd>C-g</kbd>
typed while reading with this function works like any other character,
and does not set <code>quit-flag</code>.  See <a href="Quitting.html#Quitting">Quitting</a>.

<blockquote><p>This is like <code>read-key-sequence</code> except that it always

   <p><a name="index-upper-case-key-sequence-1419"></a><a name="index-downcasing-in-_0040code_007blookup_002dkey_007d-1420"></a><a name="index-shift_002dtranslation-1421"></a>If an input character is upper-case (or has the shift modifier) and
has no key binding, but its lower-case equivalent has one, then
<code>read-key-sequence</code> converts the character to lower case.  Note
that <code>lookup-key</code> does not perform case conversion in this way.

   </p><p><a name="index-this_002dcommand_002dkeys_002dshift_002dtranslated-1422"></a>When reading input results in such a <dfn>shift-translation</dfn>, Emacs
sets the variable <code>this-command-keys-shift-translated</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value.  Lisp programs can examine this variable if they
need to modify their behavior when invoked by shift-translated keys. 
For example, the function <code>handle-shift-selection</code> examines the
value of this variable to determine how to activate or deactivate the
region (see <a href="The-Mark.html#The-Mark">handle-shift-selection</a>).

   </p><p>The function <code>read-key-sequence</code> also transforms some mouse events. 
It converts unbound drag events into click events, and discards unbound
button-down events entirely.  It also reshuffles focus events and
miscellaneous window events so that they never appear in a key sequence
with any other events.

line or a scroll bar, the event type shows nothing special—it is the
same symbol that would normally represent that combination of mouse
button and modifier keys.  The information about the window part is kept
elsewhere in the event—in the coordinates.  But
<code>read-key-sequence</code> translates this information into imaginary
“prefix keys”, all of which are symbols: <code>header-line</code>,
<code>horizontal-scroll-bar</code>, <code>menu-bar</code>, <code>mode-line</code>,
<code>vertical-line</code>, and <code>vertical-scroll-bar</code>.  You can define
meanings for mouse clicks in special window parts by defining key
sequences using these imaginary prefix keys.

   </p><p>For example, if you call <code>read-key-sequence</code> and then click the
mouse on the window's mode line, you get two events, like this:

</p><pre class="example">     (read-key-sequence "Click on the mode line: ")
          ⇒ [mode-line
              (mouse-1
               (#&lt;window 6 on NEWS&gt; mode-line
                (40 . 63) 5959987))]
