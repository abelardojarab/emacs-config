<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.6.1 Drawing Lists as Box Diagrams</h5>

<p><a name="index-box-diagrams_002c-for-lists-97"></a><a name="index-diagrams_002c-boxed_002c-for-lists-98"></a>
  A list can be illustrated by a diagram in which the cons cells are
shown as pairs of boxes, like dominoes.  (The Lisp reader cannot read
such an illustration; unlike the textual notation, which can be
understood by both humans and computers, the box illustrations can be
understood only by humans.)  This picture represents the three-element
list <code>(rose violet buttercup)</code>:

<pre class="example">         --- ---      --- ---      --- ---
        |   |   |--&gt; |   |   |--&gt; |   |   |--&gt; nil
         --- ---      --- ---      --- ---
          |            |            |
          |            |            |
           --&gt; rose     --&gt; violet   --&gt; buttercup
</pre>
   <p>In this diagram, each box represents a slot that can hold or refer to
any Lisp object.  Each pair of boxes represents a cons cell.  Each arrow
represents a reference to a Lisp object, either an atom or another cons
cell.

   <p>In this example, the first box, which holds the <span class="sc">car</span> of the first
cons cell, refers to or &ldquo;holds&rdquo; <code>rose</code> (a symbol).  The second
box, holding the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the first cons cell, refers to the next
pair of boxes, the second cons cell.  The <span class="sc">car</span> of the second cons
cell is <code>violet</code>, and its <span class="sc">cdr</span> is the third cons cell.  The
<span class="sc">cdr</span> of the third (and last) cons cell is <code>nil</code>.

   <p>Here is another diagram of the same list, <code>(rose violet
buttercup)</code>, sketched in a different manner:

<pre class="smallexample">      ---------------       ----------------       -------------------
     | car   | cdr   |     | car    | cdr   |     | car       | cdr   |
     | rose  |   o--------&gt;| violet |   o--------&gt;| buttercup |  nil  |
     |       |       |     |        |       |     |           |       |
      ---------------       ----------------       -------------------
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnil_007d-as-a-list-99"></a><a name="index-empty-list-100"></a>  A list with no elements in it is the <dfn>empty list</dfn>; it is identical
to the symbol <code>nil</code>.  In other words, <code>nil</code> is both a symbol
and a list.

   <p>Here is the list <code>(A ())</code>, or equivalently <code>(A nil)</code>,
depicted with boxes and arrows:

<pre class="example">         --- ---      --- ---
        |   |   |--&gt; |   |   |--&gt; nil
         --- ---      --- ---
          |            |
          |            |
           --&gt; A        --&gt; nil
</pre>
   <p>Here is a more complex illustration, showing the three-element list,
<code>((pine needles) oak maple)</code>, the first element of which is a
two-element list:

<pre class="example">         --- ---      --- ---      --- ---
        |   |   |--&gt; |   |   |--&gt; |   |   |--&gt; nil
         --- ---      --- ---      --- ---
          |            |            |
          |            |            |
          |             --&gt; oak      --&gt; maple
          |
          |     --- ---      --- ---
           --&gt; |   |   |--&gt; |   |   |--&gt; nil
                --- ---      --- ---
                 |            |
                 |            |
                  --&gt; pine     --&gt; needles
</pre>
   <p>The same list represented in the second box notation looks like this:

<pre class="example">      --------------       --------------       --------------
     | car   | cdr  |     | car   | cdr  |     | car   | cdr  |
     |   o   |   o-------&gt;| oak   |   o-------&gt;| maple |  nil |
     |   |   |      |     |       |      |     |       |      |
      -- | ---------       --------------       --------------
         |
         |
         |        --------------       ----------------
         |       | car   | cdr  |     | car     | cdr  |
          ------&gt;| pine  |   o-------&gt;| needles |  nil |
                 |       |      |     |         |      |
                  --------------       ----------------
</pre>
