<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.3.3 Control-Character Syntax</h5>

<p><a name="index-control-characters-79"></a>  Control characters can be represented using yet another read syntax. 
This consists of a question mark followed by a backslash, caret, and the
corresponding non-control character, in either upper or lower case.  For
example, both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?\^I</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?\^i</span></samp>&rsquo; are valid read syntax for the
character <kbd>C-i</kbd>, the character whose value is 9.

   <p>Instead of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;, you can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-</span></samp>&rsquo;; thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?\C-i</span></samp>&rsquo; is
equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?\^I</span></samp>&rsquo; and to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?\^i</span></samp>&rsquo;:

<pre class="example">     ?\^I &rArr; 9     ?\C-I &rArr; 9
</pre>
   <p>In strings and buffers, the only control characters allowed are those
that exist in <acronym>ASCII</acronym>; but for keyboard input purposes, you can turn
any character into a control character with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The character
codes for these non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters include the
2**26
bit as well as the code for the corresponding non-control character. 
Ordinary text terminals have no way of generating non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
control characters, but you can generate them straightforwardly using
X and other window systems.

   <p>For historical reasons, Emacs treats the &lt;DEL&gt; character as
the control equivalent of <kbd>?</kbd>:

<pre class="example">     ?\^? &rArr; 127     ?\C-? &rArr; 127
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As a result, it is currently not possible to represent the character
<kbd>Control-?</kbd>, which is a meaningful input character under X, using
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\C-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  It is not easy to change this, as various Lisp files refer
to &lt;DEL&gt; in this way.

   <p>For representing control characters to be found in files or strings,
we recommend the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; syntax; for control characters in keyboard
input, we prefer the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-</span></samp>&rsquo; syntax.  Which one you use does not
affect the meaning of the program, but may guide the understanding of
people who read it.
