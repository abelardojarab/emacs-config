<h4 class="subsection">11.9.3 Lexical Binding</h4>

<p>Lexical binding was introduced to Emacs, as an optional feature, in
version 24.1.  We expect its importance to increase in the future. 
Lexical binding opens up many more opportunities for optimization, so
programs using it are likely to run faster in future Emacs versions. 
Lexical binding is also more compatible with concurrency, which we
want to add to Emacs in the future.

   <p>A lexically-bound variable has <dfn>lexical scope</dfn>, meaning that any
reference to the variable must be located textually within the binding
construct.  Here is an example
(see <a href="Using-Lexical-Binding.html#Using-Lexical-Binding">Using Lexical Binding</a>, for how to actually enable lexical binding):

<pre class="example">     (let ((x 1))    ; <code>x</code><span class="roman"> is lexically bound.</span>
       (+ x 3))
          &rArr; 4
     
     (defun getx ()
       x)            ; <code>x</code><span class="roman"> is used ``free'' in this function.</span>
     
     (let ((x 1))    ; <code>x</code><span class="roman"> is lexically bound.</span>
       (getx))
     error--&gt; Symbol's value as variable is void: x
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, the variable <code>x</code> has no global value.  When it is lexically
bound within a <code>let</code> form, it can be used in the textual confines
of that <code>let</code> form.  But it can <em>not</em> be used from within a
<code>getx</code> function called from the <code>let</code> form, since the
function definition of <code>getx</code> occurs outside the <code>let</code> form
itself.

   <p><a name="index-lexical-environment-658"></a>  Here is how lexical binding works.  Each binding construct defines a
<dfn>lexical environment</dfn>, specifying the symbols that are bound
within the construct and their local values.  When the Lisp evaluator
wants the current value of a variable, it looks first in the lexical
environment; if the variable is not specified in there, it looks in
the symbol's value cell, where the dynamic value is stored.

   <p>(Internally, the lexical environment is an alist of symbol-value
pairs, with the final element in the alist being the symbol <code>t</code>
rather than a cons cell.  Such an alist can be passed as the second
argument to the <code>eval</code> function, in order to specify a lexical
environment in which to evaluate a form.  See <a href="Eval.html#Eval">Eval</a>.  Most Emacs
Lisp programs, however, should not interact directly with lexical
environments in this way; only specialized programs like debuggers.)

   <p><a name="index-closures_002c-example-of-using-659"></a>  Lexical bindings have indefinite extent.  Even after a binding
construct has finished executing, its lexical environment can be
&ldquo;kept around&rdquo; in Lisp objects called <dfn>closures</dfn>.  A closure is
created when you define a named or anonymous function with lexical
binding enabled.  See <a href="Closures.html#Closures">Closures</a>, for details.

   <p>When a closure is called as a function, any lexical variable
references within its definition use the retained lexical environment. 
Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     (defvar my-ticker nil)   ; <span class="roman">We will use this dynamically bound</span>
                              ; <span class="roman">variable to store a closure.</span>
     
     (let ((x 0))             ; <code>x</code><span class="roman"> is lexically bound.</span>
       (setq my-ticker (lambda ()
                         (setq x (1+ x)))))
         &rArr; (closure ((x . 0) t) ()
               (setq x (1+ x)))
     
     (funcall my-ticker)
         &rArr; 1
     
     (funcall my-ticker)
         &rArr; 2
     
     (funcall my-ticker)
         &rArr; 3
     
     x                        ; <span class="roman">Note that </span><code>x</code><span class="roman"> has no global value.</span>
     error--&gt; Symbol's value as variable is void: x
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>let</code> binding defines a lexical environment in which the
variable <code>x</code> is locally bound to 0.  Within this binding
construct, we define a lambda expression which increments <code>x</code> by
one and returns the incremented value.  This lambda expression is
automatically turned into a closure, in which the lexical environment
lives on even after the <code>let</code> binding construct has exited.  Each
time we evaluate the closure, it increments <code>x</code>, using the
binding of <code>x</code> in that lexical environment.

   <p>Note that functions like <code>symbol-value</code>, <code>boundp</code>, and
<code>set</code> only retrieve or modify a variable's dynamic binding
(i.e., the contents of its symbol's value cell).  Also, the code in
the body of a <code>defun</code> or <code>defmacro</code> cannot refer to
surrounding lexical variables.
