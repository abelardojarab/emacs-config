<h3 class="section">37.6 Invisible Text</h3>

<p><a name="index-invisible-text-3784"></a>You can make characters <dfn>invisible</dfn>, so that they do not appear on
the screen, with the <code>invisible</code> property.  This can be either a
text property (see <a href="Text-Properties.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>) or an overlay property
(see <a href="Overlays.html#Overlays">Overlays</a>).  Cursor motion also partly ignores these
characters; if the command loop finds that point is inside a range of
invisible text after a command, it relocates point to the other side
of the text.

   </p><p>In the simplest case, any non-<code>nil</code> <code>invisible</code> property makes
a character invisible.  This is the default case—if you don't alter
the default value of <code>buffer-invisibility-spec</code>, this is how the
<code>invisible</code> property works.  You should normally use <code>t</code>
as the value of the <code>invisible</code> property if you don't plan
to set <code>buffer-invisibility-spec</code> yourself.

   </p><p>More generally, you can use the variable <code>buffer-invisibility-spec</code>
to control which values of the <code>invisible</code> property make text
invisible.  This permits you to classify the text into different subsets
in advance, by giving them different <code>invisible</code> values, and
subsequently make various subsets visible or invisible by changing the
value of <code>buffer-invisibility-spec</code>.

   </p><p>Controlling visibility with <code>buffer-invisibility-spec</code> is
especially useful in a program to display the list of entries in a
database.  It permits the implementation of convenient filtering
commands to view just a part of the entries in the database.  Setting
this variable is very fast, much faster than scanning all the text in
the buffer looking for properties to change.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/buffer%2Dinvisibility%2Dspec"></a><a name="DASH-1142"></a>— Variable: <b>buffer-invisibility-spec</b><var><a name="index-buffer_002dinvisibility_002dspec-3785"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable specifies which kinds of <code>invisible</code> properties
actually make a character invisible.  Setting this variable makes it
buffer-local.

          </p><dl>
<dt><code>t</code></dt><dd>A character is invisible if its <code>invisible</code> property is
non-<code>nil</code>.  This is the default.

          <br></dd><dt>a list</dt><dd>Each element of the list specifies a criterion for invisibility; if a
character's <code>invisible</code> property fits any one of these criteria,
the character is invisible.  The list can have two kinds of elements:

               <dl>
<dt><var>atom</var></dt><dd>A character is invisible if its <code>invisible</code> property value is
<var>atom</var> or if it is a list with <var>atom</var> as a member; comparison
is done with <code>eq</code>.

               <br></dd><dt><code>(</code><var>atom</var><code> . t)</code></dt><dd>A character is invisible if its <code>invisible</code> property value is
<var>atom</var> or if it is a list with <var>atom</var> as a member; comparison
is done with <code>eq</code>.  Moreover, a sequence of such characters
displays as an ellipsis. 
</dd></dl>
          </dd></dl>
        <p></p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Two functions are specifically provided for adding elements to
<code>buffer-invisibility-spec</code> and removing elements from it.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/add%2Dto%2Dinvisibility%2Dspec"></a><a name="DASH-1143"></a>— Function: <b>add-to-invisibility-spec</b><var> element<a name="index-add_002dto_002dinvisibility_002dspec-3786"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function adds the element <var>element</var> to
<code>buffer-invisibility-spec</code>.  If <code>buffer-invisibility-spec</code>
was <code>t</code>, it changes to a list, <code>(t)</code>, so that text whose
<code>invisible</code> property is <code>t</code> remains invisible. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/remove%2Dfrom%2Dinvisibility%2Dspec"></a><a name="DASH-1144"></a>— Function: <b>remove-from-invisibility-spec</b><var> element<a name="index-remove_002dfrom_002dinvisibility_002dspec-3787"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This removes the element <var>element</var> from
<code>buffer-invisibility-spec</code>.  This does nothing if <var>element</var>
is not in the list. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>A convention for use of <code>buffer-invisibility-spec</code> is that a
major mode should use the mode's own name as an element of
<code>buffer-invisibility-spec</code> and as the value of the
<code>invisible</code> property:

</p><pre class="example">     ;; <span class="roman">If you want to display an ellipsis:</span>
     (add-to-invisibility-spec '(my-symbol . t))
     ;; <span class="roman">If you don't want ellipsis:</span>
     (add-to-invisibility-spec 'my-symbol)
     
     (overlay-put (make-overlay beginning end)
                  'invisible 'my-symbol)
     
     ;; <span class="roman">When done with the invisibility:</span>
     (remove-from-invisibility-spec '(my-symbol . t))
     ;; <span class="roman">Or respectively:</span>
     (remove-from-invisibility-spec 'my-symbol)
</pre>
   <p>You can check for invisibility using the following function:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/invisible%2Dp"></a><a name="DASH-1145"></a>— Function: <b>invisible-p</b><var> pos-or-prop<a name="index-invisible_002dp-3788"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If <var>pos-or-prop</var> is a marker or number, this function returns a
non-<code>nil</code> value if the text at that position is invisible.

        </p><p>If <var>pos-or-prop</var> is any other kind of Lisp object, that is taken
to mean a possible value of the <code>invisible</code> text or overlay
property.  In that case, this function returns a non-<code>nil</code> value
if that value would cause text to become invisible, based on the
current value of <code>buffer-invisibility-spec</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-line_002dmove_002dignore_002dinvisible-3789"></a>  Ordinarily, functions that operate on text or move point do not care
whether the text is invisible, they process invisible characters and
visible characters alike.  The user-level line motion commands,
such as <code>next-line</code>, <code>previous-line</code>, ignore invisible
newlines if <code>line-move-ignore-invisible</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (the
default), i.e., behave like these invisible newlines didn't exist in
the buffer, but only because they are explicitly programmed to do so.

   </p><p>If a command ends with point inside or at the boundary of
invisible text, the main editing loop relocates point to one of the
two ends of the invisible text.  Emacs chooses the direction of
relocation so that it is the same as the overall movement direction of
the command; if in doubt, it prefers a position where an inserted char
would not inherit the <code>invisible</code> property.  Additionally, if the
text is not replaced by an ellipsis and the command only moved within
the invisible text, then point is moved one extra character so as to
try and reflect the command's movement by a visible movement of the
cursor.

   </p><p>Thus, if the command moved point back to an invisible range (with the usual
stickiness), Emacs moves point back to the beginning of that range.  If the
command moved point forward into an invisible range, Emacs moves point forward
to the first visible character that follows the invisible text and then forward
one more character.

   </p><p>These <dfn>adjustments</dfn> of point that ended up in the middle of
invisible text can be disabled by setting <code>disable-point-adjustment</code>
to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  See <a href="Adjusting-Point.html#Adjusting-Point">Adjusting Point</a>.

   </p><p>Incremental search can make invisible overlays visible temporarily
and/or permanently when a match includes invisible text.  To enable
this, the overlay should have a non-<code>nil</code>
<code>isearch-open-invisible</code> property.  The property value should be a
function to be called with the overlay as an argument.  This function
should make the overlay visible permanently; it is used when the match
overlaps the overlay on exit from the search.

   </p><p>During the search, such overlays are made temporarily visible by
temporarily modifying their invisible and intangible properties.  If you
want this to be done differently for a certain overlay, give it an
<code>isearch-open-invisible-temporary</code> property which is a function. 
The function is called with two arguments: the first is the overlay, and
the second is <code>nil</code> to make the overlay visible, or <code>t</code> to
make it invisible again.
