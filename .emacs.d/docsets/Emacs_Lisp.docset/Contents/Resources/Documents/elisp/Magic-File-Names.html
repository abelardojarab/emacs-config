<h3 class="section">24.11 Making Certain File Names “Magic”</h3>

<p><a name="index-magic-file-names-2061"></a>
  You can implement special handling for certain file names.  This is
called making those names <dfn>magic</dfn>.  The principal use for this
feature is in implementing access to remote files (see <a href="../emacs/Remote-Files.html#Remote-Files">Remote Files</a>).

   </p><p>To define a kind of magic file name, you must supply a regular
expression to define the class of names (all those that match the
regular expression), plus a handler that implements all the primitive
Emacs file operations for file names that match.

   </p><p><a name="index-file-handler-2062"></a><a name="index-file_002dname_002dhandler_002dalist-2063"></a>  The variable <code>file-name-handler-alist</code> holds a list of handlers,
together with regular expressions that determine when to apply each
handler.  Each element has this form:

</p><pre class="example">     (<var>regexp</var> . <var>handler</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">All the Emacs primitives for file access and file name transformation
check the given file name against <code>file-name-handler-alist</code>.  If
the file name matches <var>regexp</var>, the primitives handle that file by
calling <var>handler</var>.

   </p><p>The first argument given to <var>handler</var> is the name of the
primitive, as a symbol; the remaining arguments are the arguments that
were passed to that primitive.  (The first of these arguments is most
often the file name itself.)  For example, if you do this:

</p><pre class="example">     (file-exists-p <var>filename</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and <var>filename</var> has handler <var>handler</var>, then <var>handler</var> is
called like this:

</p><pre class="example">     (funcall <var>handler</var> 'file-exists-p <var>filename</var>)
</pre>
   <p>When a function takes two or more arguments that must be file names,
it checks each of those names for a handler.  For example, if you do
this:

</p><pre class="example">     (expand-file-name <var>filename</var> <var>dirname</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then it checks for a handler for <var>filename</var> and then for a handler
for <var>dirname</var>.  In either case, the <var>handler</var> is called like
this:

</p><pre class="example">     (funcall <var>handler</var> 'expand-file-name <var>filename</var> <var>dirname</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <var>handler</var> then needs to figure out whether to handle
<var>filename</var> or <var>dirname</var>.

   </p><p>If the specified file name matches more than one handler, the one
whose match starts last in the file name gets precedence.  This rule
is chosen so that handlers for jobs such as uncompression are handled
first, before handlers for jobs such as remote file access.

   </p><p>Here are the operations that a magic file name handler gets to handle:

</p><p class="noindent"><code>access-file</code>, <code>add-name-to-file</code>,
<code>byte-compiler-base-file-name</code>,<br>
<code>copy-directory</code>, <code>copy-file</code>,
<code>delete-directory</code>, <code>delete-file</code>,
<code>diff-latest-backup-file</code>,
<code>directory-file-name</code>,
<code>directory-files</code>,
<code>directory-files-and-attributes</code>,
<code>dired-compress-file</code>, <code>dired-uncache</code>,<br>
<code>expand-file-name</code>,
<code>file-accessible-directory-p</code>,
<code>file-acl</code>,
<code>file-attributes</code>,
<code>file-directory-p</code>,
<code>file-equal-p</code>,
<code>file-executable-p</code>, <code>file-exists-p</code>,
<code>file-in-directory-p</code>,
<code>file-local-copy</code>,
<code>file-modes</code>, <code>file-name-all-completions</code>,
<code>file-name-as-directory</code>,
<code>file-name-completion</code>,
<code>file-name-directory</code>,
<code>file-name-nondirectory</code>,
<code>file-name-sans-versions</code>, <code>file-newer-than-file-p</code>,
<code>file-notify-add-watch</code>, <code>file-notify-rm-watch</code>,
<code>file-ownership-preserved-p</code>,
<code>file-readable-p</code>, <code>file-regular-p</code>,
<code>file-remote-p</code>, <code>file-selinux-context</code>,
<code>file-symlink-p</code>, <code>file-truename</code>, <code>file-writable-p</code>,
<code>find-backup-file-name</code>,
<!-- Not sure why it was here:   @code{find-file-noselect},@* -->
<code>get-file-buffer</code>,
<code>insert-directory</code>,
<code>insert-file-contents</code>,<br>
<code>load</code>,
<code>make-auto-save-file-name</code>,
<code>make-directory</code>,
<code>make-directory-internal</code>,
<code>make-symbolic-link</code>,<br>
<code>process-file</code>,
<code>rename-file</code>, <code>set-file-acl</code>, <code>set-file-modes</code>,
<code>set-file-selinux-context</code>, <code>set-file-times</code>,
<code>set-visited-file-modtime</code>, <code>shell-command</code>,
<code>start-file-process</code>,
<code>substitute-in-file-name</code>,<br>
<code>unhandled-file-name-directory</code>,
<code>vc-registered</code>,
<code>verify-visited-file-modtime</code>,<br>
<code>write-region</code>.

   </p><p>Handlers for <code>insert-file-contents</code> typically need to clear the
buffer's modified flag, with <code>(set-buffer-modified-p nil)</code>, if the
<var>visit</var> argument is non-<code>nil</code>.  This also has the effect of
unlocking the buffer if it is locked.

   </p><p>The handler function must handle all of the above operations, and
possibly others to be added in the future.  It need not implement all
these operations itself—when it has nothing special to do for a
certain operation, it can reinvoke the primitive, to handle the
operation “in the usual way”.  It should always reinvoke the primitive
for an operation it does not recognize.  Here's one way to do this:

</p><pre class="smallexample">     (defun my-file-handler (operation &amp;rest args)
       ;; <span class="roman">First check for the specific operations</span>
       ;; <span class="roman">that we have special handling for.</span>
       (cond ((eq operation 'insert-file-contents) ...)
             ((eq operation 'write-region) ...)
             ...
             ;; <span class="roman">Handle any operation we don't know about.</span>
             (t (let ((inhibit-file-name-handlers
                       (cons 'my-file-handler
                             (and (eq inhibit-file-name-operation operation)
                                  inhibit-file-name-handlers)))
                      (inhibit-file-name-operation operation))
                  (apply operation args)))))
</pre>
   <p>When a handler function decides to call the ordinary Emacs primitive for
the operation at hand, it needs to prevent the primitive from calling
the same handler once again, thus leading to an infinite recursion.  The
example above shows how to do this, with the variables
<code>inhibit-file-name-handlers</code> and
<code>inhibit-file-name-operation</code>.  Be careful to use them exactly as
shown above; the details are crucial for proper behavior in the case of
multiple handlers, and for operations that have two file names that may
each have handlers.

   </p><p><a name="index-safe_002dmagic-_0028_0040r_007bproperty_007d_0029-2064"></a>  Handlers that don't really do anything special for actual access to the
file—such as the ones that implement completion of host names for
remote file names—should have a non-<code>nil</code> <code>safe-magic</code>
property.  For instance, Emacs normally “protects” directory names
it finds in <code>PATH</code> from becoming magic, if they look like magic
file names, by prefixing them with ‘<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>’.  But if the handler that
would be used for them has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>safe-magic</code>
property, the ‘<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>’ is not added.

   </p><p><a name="index-operations-_0028_0040r_007bproperty_007d_0029-2065"></a>  A file name handler can have an <code>operations</code> property to
declare which operations it handles in a nontrivial way.  If this
property has a non-<code>nil</code> value, it should be a list of
operations; then only those operations will call the handler.  This
avoids inefficiency, but its main purpose is for autoloaded handler
functions, so that they won't be loaded except when they have real
work to do.

   </p><p>Simply deferring all operations to the usual primitives does not
work.  For instance, if the file name handler applies to
<code>file-exists-p</code>, then it must handle <code>load</code> itself, because
the usual <code>load</code> code won't work properly in that case.  However,
if the handler uses the <code>operations</code> property to say it doesn't
handle <code>file-exists-p</code>, then it need not handle <code>load</code>
nontrivially.

other purposes than remote file access should not handle
<code>file-local-copy</code>; then this function will treat the file as
local.

identifies the remote system.

        </p><p>This identifier string can include a host name and a user name, as
well as characters designating the method used to access the remote
system.  For example, the remote identifier string for the filename
<code>/sudo::/some/file</code> is <code>/sudo:root@localhost:</code>.

        </p><p>If <code>file-remote-p</code> returns the same identifier for two different
filenames, that means they are stored on the same file system and can
be accessed locally with respect to each other.  This means, for
example, that it is possible to start a remote process accessing both
files at the same time.  Implementers of file handlers need to ensure
this principle is valid.

In the example above, the remote <code>user</code> identifier string would
be <code>root</code>.

even if <var>filename</var> is remote, if Emacs has no network connection
to its host.  This is useful when you want to avoid the delay of
making connections when they don't exist.

expired.  Use this setting with caution, only if you are sure nothing
other than Emacs ever changes the remote files.  If it is set to

could result in performance degradation.

cached values are used for that amount of seconds since they were

idea to let-bind this variable to a value less than the time period
between consecutive checks.  For example:
