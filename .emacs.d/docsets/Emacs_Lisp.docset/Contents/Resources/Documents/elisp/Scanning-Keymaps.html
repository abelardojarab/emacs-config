<h3 class="section">21.16 Scanning Keymaps</h3>

<p>This section describes functions used to scan all the current keymaps
for the sake of printing help information.

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/accessible%2Dkeymaps"></a><a name="DASH-1811"></a>— Function: <b>accessible-keymaps</b><var> keymap &amp;optional prefix<a name="index-accessible_002dkeymaps-1636"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a list of all the keymaps that can be reached (via
zero or more prefix keys) from <var>keymap</var>.  The value is an
association list with elements of the form <code>(</code><var>key</var><code> . 
</code><var>map</var><code>)</code>, where <var>key</var> is a prefix key whose definition in
<var>keymap</var> is <var>map</var>.

        </p><p>The elements of the alist are ordered so that the <var>key</var> increases
in length.  The first element is always <code>([] . </code><var>keymap</var><code>)</code>,
because the specified keymap is accessible from itself with a prefix of
no events.

        </p><p>If <var>prefix</var> is given, it should be a prefix key sequence; then
<code>accessible-keymaps</code> includes only the submaps whose prefixes start
with <var>prefix</var>.  These elements look just as they do in the value of
<code>(accessible-keymaps)</code>; the only difference is that some elements
are omitted.

        </p><p>In the example below, the returned alist indicates that the key
&lt;ESC&gt;, which is displayed as ‘<samp><span class="samp">^[</span></samp>’, is a prefix key whose
definition is the sparse keymap <code>(keymap (83 . center-paragraph)
(115 . foo))</code>.

     </p><pre class="smallexample">          (accessible-keymaps (current-local-map))
          ⇒(([] keymap
                (27 keymap   ; <span class="roman">Note this keymap for &lt;ESC&gt; is repeated below.</span>
                    (83 . center-paragraph)
                    (115 . center-line))
                (9 . tab-to-tab-stop))
          
             ("^[" keymap
              (83 . center-paragraph)
              (115 . foo)))
</pre>
        <p>In the following example, <kbd>C-h</kbd> is a prefix key that uses a sparse
keymap starting with <code>(keymap (118 . describe-variable)...)</code>. 
Another prefix, <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>, uses a keymap which is also the value of
the variable <code>ctl-x-4-map</code>.  The event <code>mode-line</code> is one of
several dummy events used as prefixes for mouse actions in special parts
of a window.

     </p><pre class="smallexample">          (accessible-keymaps (current-global-map))
          ⇒ (([] keymap [set-mark-command beginning-of-line ...
                             delete-backward-char])
              ("^H" keymap (118 . describe-variable) ...
               (8 . help-for-help))
              ("^X" keymap [x-flush-mouse-queue ...
               backward-kill-sentence])
              ("^[" keymap [mark-sexp backward-sexp ...
               backward-kill-word])
              ("^X4" keymap (15 . display-buffer) ...)
              ([mode-line] keymap
               (S-mouse-2 . mouse-split-window-horizontally) ...))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">These are not all the keymaps you would see in actuality.

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/map%2Dkeymap"></a><a name="DASH-1812"></a>— Function: <b>map-keymap</b><var> function keymap<a name="index-map_002dkeymap-1637"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The function <code>map-keymap</code> calls <var>function</var> once
for each binding in <var>keymap</var>.  It passes two arguments,
the event type and the value of the binding.  If <var>keymap</var>
has a parent, the parent's bindings are included as well. 
This works recursively: if the parent has itself a parent, then the
grandparent's bindings are also included and so on.

        </p><p>This function is the cleanest way to examine all the bindings
in a keymap. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/where%2Dis%2Dinternal"></a><a name="DASH-1813"></a>— Function: <b>where-is-internal</b><var> command &amp;optional keymap firstonly noindirect no-remap<a name="index-where_002dis_002dinternal-1638"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is a subroutine used by the <code>where-is</code> command
(see <a href="../emacs/Help.html#Help">Help</a>).  It returns a list
of all key sequences (of any length) that are bound to <var>command</var> in a
set of keymaps.

        </p><p>The argument <var>command</var> can be any object; it is compared with all
keymap entries using <code>eq</code>.

        </p><p>If <var>keymap</var> is <code>nil</code>, then the maps used are the current active
keymaps, disregarding <code>overriding-local-map</code> (that is, pretending
its value is <code>nil</code>).  If <var>keymap</var> is a keymap, then the
maps searched are <var>keymap</var> and the global keymap.  If <var>keymap</var>
is a list of keymaps, only those keymaps are searched.

        </p><p>Usually it's best to use <code>overriding-local-map</code> as the expression
for <var>keymap</var>.  Then <code>where-is-internal</code> searches precisely
the keymaps that are active.  To search only the global map, pass the
value <code>(keymap)</code> (an empty keymap) as <var>keymap</var>.

        </p><p>If <var>firstonly</var> is <code>non-ascii</code>, then the value is a single
vector representing the first key sequence found, rather than a list of
all possible key sequences.  If <var>firstonly</var> is <code>t</code>, then the
value is the first key sequence, except that key sequences consisting
entirely of <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters (or meta variants of <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters) are preferred to all other key sequences and that the
return value can never be a menu binding.

        </p><p>If <var>noindirect</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>where-is-internal</code> doesn't
follow indirect keymap bindings.  This makes it possible to search for
an indirect definition itself.

        </p><p>The fifth argument, <var>no-remap</var>, determines how this function
treats command remappings (see <a href="Remapping-Commands.html#Remapping-Commands">Remapping Commands</a>).  There are two
cases of interest:

          </p><dl>
<dt>If a command <var>other-command</var> is remapped to <var>command</var>:</dt><dd>If <var>no-remap</var> is <code>nil</code>, find the bindings for
<var>other-command</var> and treat them as though they are also bindings
for <var>command</var>.  If <var>no-remap</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, include the
vector <code>[remap </code><var>other-command</var><code>]</code> in the list of possible key
sequences, instead of finding those bindings.

          <br></dd><dt>If <var>command</var> is remapped to <var>other-command</var>:</dt><dd>If <var>no-remap</var> is <code>nil</code>, return the bindings for
<var>other-command</var> rather than <var>command</var>.  If <var>no-remap</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, return the bindings for <var>command</var>, ignoring the
fact that it is remapped.

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/describe%2Dbindings"></a><a name="DASH-1814"></a>— Command: <b>describe-bindings</b><var> &amp;optional prefix buffer-or-name<a name="index-describe_002dbindings-1639"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function creates a listing of all current key bindings, and
displays it in a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp>.  The text is grouped by
modes—minor modes first, then the major mode, then global bindings.

        </p><p>If <var>prefix</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it should be a prefix key; then the
listing includes only keys that start with <var>prefix</var>.

        </p><p>When several characters with consecutive <acronym>ASCII</acronym> codes have the
same definition, they are shown together, as
‘<samp><var>firstchar</var><span class="samp">..</span><var>lastchar</var></samp>’.  In this instance, you need to
know the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> codes to understand which characters this means. 
For example, in the default global map, the characters ‘<samp><span class="samp">&lt;SPC&gt;
.. ~</span></samp>’ are described by a single line.  &lt;SPC&gt; is <acronym>ASCII</acronym> 32,
<kbd>~</kbd> is <acronym>ASCII</acronym> 126, and the characters between them include all
the normal printing characters, (e.g., letters, digits, punctuation,
etc.); all these characters are bound to <code>self-insert-command</code>.

        </p><p>If <var>buffer-or-name</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it should be a buffer or a
buffer name.  Then <code>describe-bindings</code> lists that buffer's bindings,
instead of the current buffer's.
