<h4 class="subsection">11.9.2 Proper Use of Dynamic Binding</h4>

<p>Dynamic binding is a powerful feature, as it allows programs to
refer to variables that are not defined within their local textual
scope.  However, if used without restraint, this can also make
programs hard to understand.  There are two clean ways to use this
technique:

     <ul>
<li>If a variable has no global definition, use it as a local variable
only within a binding construct, such as the body of the <code>let</code>
form where the variable was bound.  If this convention is followed
consistently throughout a program, the value of the variable will not
affect, nor be affected by, any uses of the same variable symbol
elsewhere in the program.

     <li>Otherwise, define the variable with <code>defvar</code>, <code>defconst</code>, or
<code>defcustom</code>.  See <a href="Defining-Variables.html#Defining-Variables">Defining Variables</a>.  Usually, the definition
should be at top-level in an Emacs Lisp file.  As far as possible, it
should include a documentation string which explains the meaning and
purpose of the variable.  You should also choose the variable's name
to avoid name conflicts (see <a href="Coding-Conventions.html#Coding-Conventions">Coding Conventions</a>).

     <p>Then you can bind the variable anywhere in a program, knowing reliably
what the effect will be.  Wherever you encounter the variable, it will
be easy to refer back to the definition, e.g., via the <kbd>C-h v</kbd>
command (provided the variable definition has been loaded into Emacs). 
See <a href="../emacs/Name-Help.html#Name-Help">Name Help</a>.

     <p>For example, it is common to use local bindings for customizable
variables like <code>case-fold-search</code>:

     <pre class="example">          (defun search-for-abc ()
            "Search for the string \"abc\", ignoring case differences."
            (let ((case-fold-search nil))
              (re-search-forward "abc")))
</pre>
     </ul>

   </body></html>
