<h4 class="subsection">34.6.1 Motion Commands Based on Parsing</h4>

<p>This section describes simple point-motion functions that operate
based on parsing expressions.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/scan%2Dlists"></a><a name="DASH-1440"></a>— Function: <b>scan-lists</b><var> from count depth<a name="index-scan_002dlists-3491"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function scans forward <var>count</var> balanced parenthetical
groupings from position <var>from</var>.  It returns the position where the
scan stops.  If <var>count</var> is negative, the scan moves backwards.

        </p><p>If <var>depth</var> is nonzero, treat the starting position as being
<var>depth</var> parentheses deep.  The scanner moves forward or backward
through the buffer until the depth changes to zero <var>count</var> times. 
Hence, a positive value for <var>depth</var> has the effect of moving out
<var>depth</var> levels of parenthesis from the starting position, while a
negative <var>depth</var> has the effect of moving deeper by <var>-depth</var>
levels of parenthesis.

        </p><p>Scanning ignores comments if <code>parse-sexp-ignore-comments</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>If the scan reaches the beginning or end of the accessible part of the
buffer before it has scanned over <var>count</var> parenthetical groupings,
the return value is <code>nil</code> if the depth at that point is zero; if
the depth is non-zero, a <code>scan-error</code> error is signaled. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/scan%2Dsexps"></a><a name="DASH-1441"></a>— Function: <b>scan-sexps</b><var> from count<a name="index-scan_002dsexps-3492"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function scans forward <var>count</var> sexps from position <var>from</var>. 
It returns the position where the scan stops.  If <var>count</var> is
negative, the scan moves backwards.

        </p><p>Scanning ignores comments if <code>parse-sexp-ignore-comments</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>If the scan reaches the beginning or end of (the accessible part of) the
buffer while in the middle of a parenthetical grouping, an error is
signaled.  If it reaches the beginning or end between groupings but
before count is used up, <code>nil</code> is returned. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/forward%2Dcomment"></a><a name="DASH-1442"></a>— Function: <b>forward-comment</b><var> count<a name="index-forward_002dcomment-3493"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function moves point forward across <var>count</var> complete comments
     (that is, including the starting delimiter and the terminating
delimiter if any), plus any whitespace encountered on the way.  It
moves backward if <var>count</var> is negative.  If it encounters anything
other than a comment or whitespace, it stops, leaving point at the
place where it stopped.  This includes (for instance) finding the end
of a comment when moving forward and expecting the beginning of one. 
The function also stops immediately after moving over the specified
number of complete comments.  If <var>count</var> comments are found as
expected, with nothing except whitespace between them, it returns
<code>t</code>; otherwise it returns <code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>This function cannot tell whether the “comments” it traverses are
embedded within a string.  If they look like comments, it treats them
as comments.

        </p><p>To move forward over all comments and whitespace following point, use
<code>(forward-comment (buffer-size))</code>.  <code>(buffer-size)</code> is a
good argument to use, because the number of comments in the buffer
cannot exceed that many.
