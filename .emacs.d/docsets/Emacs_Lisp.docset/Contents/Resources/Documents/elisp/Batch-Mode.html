<h3 class="section">38.16 Batch Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-batch-mode-4335"></a>
  The command-line option ‘<samp><span class="samp">-batch</span></samp>’ causes Emacs to run
noninteractively.  In this mode, Emacs does not read commands from the
terminal, it does not alter the terminal modes, and it does not expect
to be outputting to an erasable screen.  The idea is that you specify
Lisp programs to run; when they are finished, Emacs should exit.  The
way to specify the programs to run is with ‘<samp><span class="samp">-l </span><var>file</var></samp>’, which
loads the library named <var>file</var>, or ‘<samp><span class="samp">-f </span><var>function</var></samp>’, which
calls <var>function</var> with no arguments, or ‘<samp><span class="samp">--eval </span><var>form</var></samp>’.

   </p><p>Any Lisp program output that would normally go to the echo area,
either using <code>message</code>, or using <code>prin1</code>, etc., with <code>t</code>
as the stream, goes instead to Emacs's standard error descriptor when
in batch mode.  Similarly, input that would normally come from the
minibuffer is read from the standard input descriptor. 
Thus, Emacs behaves much like a noninteractive
application program.  (The echo area output that Emacs itself normally
generates, such as command echoing, is suppressed entirely.)
