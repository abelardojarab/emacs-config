<h3 class="section">39.4 Creating and Maintaining Package Archives</h3>

<p><a name="index-package-archive-4367"></a>
  Via the Package Menu, users may download packages from <dfn>package
archives</dfn>.  Such archives are specified by the variable
<code>package-archives</code>, whose default value contains a single entry:
the archive hosted by the GNU project at <a href="http://elpa.gnu.org">http://elpa.gnu.org</a>.  This
section describes how to set up and maintain a package archive.

   </p><p><a name="index-base-location_002c-package-archive-4368"></a>

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/package%2Darchives"></a><a name="DASH-1556"></a>— User Option: <b>package-archives</b><var><a name="index-package_002darchives-4369"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is an alist of package archives recognized
by the Emacs package manager.

        </p><p>Each alist element corresponds to one archive, and should have the
form <code>(</code><var>id</var><code> . </code><var>location</var><code>)</code>, where <var>id</var> is the name of
the archive (a string) and <var>location</var> is its <dfn>base location</dfn>
(a string).

        </p><p>If the base location starts with ‘<samp><span class="samp">http:</span></samp>’, it is treated as a HTTP
URL, and packages are downloaded from this archive via HTTP (as is the
case for the default GNU archive).

        </p><p>Otherwise, the base location should be a directory name.  In this
case, Emacs retrieves packages from this archive via ordinary file
access.  Such “local” archives are mainly useful for testing. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>A package archive is simply a directory in which the package files,
and associated files, are stored.  If you want the archive to be
reachable via HTTP, this directory must be accessible to a web server. 
How to accomplish this is beyond the scope of this manual.

   </p><p>A convenient way to set up and update a package archive is via the
<code>package-x</code> library.  This is included with Emacs, but not loaded
by default; type <kbd>M-x load-library &lt;RET&gt; package-x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to
load it, or add <code>(require 'package-x)</code> to your init file. 
See <a href="../emacs/Lisp-Libraries.html#Lisp-Libraries">Lisp Libraries</a>. 
Once loaded, you can make use of the following:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/package%2Darchive%2Dupload%2Dbase"></a><a name="DASH-1557"></a>— User Option: <b>package-archive-upload-base</b><var><a name="index-package_002darchive_002dupload_002dbase-4370"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is the base location of a package archive,
as a directory name.  The commands in the <code>package-x</code> library
will use this base location.

        </p><p>The directory name should be absolute.  You may specify a remote name,
such as <samp><span class="file">/ssh:foo@example.com:/var/www/packages/</span></samp>, if the
package archive is on a different machine.  See <a href="../emacs/Remote-Files.html#Remote-Files">Remote Files</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/package%2Dupload%2Dfile"></a><a name="DASH-1558"></a>— Command: <b>package-upload-file</b><var> filename<a name="index-package_002dupload_002dfile-4371"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command prompts for <var>filename</var>, a file name, and uploads that
file to <code>package-archive-upload-base</code>.  The file must be either a
simple package (a <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> file) or a multi-file package (a
<samp><span class="file">.tar</span></samp> file); otherwise, an error is raised.  The package
attributes are automatically extracted, and the archive's contents
list is updated with this information.

        </p><p>If <code>package-archive-upload-base</code> does not specify a valid
directory, the function prompts interactively for one.  If the
directory does not exist, it is created.  The directory need not have
any initial contents (i.e., you can use this command to populate an
initially empty archive). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/package%2Dupload%2Dbuffer"></a><a name="DASH-1559"></a>— Command: <b>package-upload-buffer</b><var><a name="index-package_002dupload_002dbuffer-4372"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command is similar to <code>package-upload-file</code>, but instead of
prompting for a package file, it uploads the contents of the current
buffer.  The current buffer must be visiting a simple package (a
<samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> file) or a multi-file package (a <samp><span class="file">.tar</span></samp> file);
otherwise, an error is raised. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<p class="noindent">After you create an archive, remember that it is not accessible in the
Package Menu interface unless it is in <code>package-archives</code>.

   </p><p><a name="index-package-archive-security-4373"></a><a name="index-package-signing-4374"></a>Maintaining a public package archive entails a degree of responsibility. 
When Emacs users install packages from your archive, those packages
can cause Emacs to run arbitrary code with the permissions of the
installing user.  (This is true for Emacs code in general, not just
for packages.)  So you should ensure that your archive is
well-maintained and keep the hosting system secure.

   </p><p>One way to increase the security of your packages is to <dfn>sign</dfn>
them using a cryptographic key.  If you have generated a
private/public gpg key pair, you can use gpg to sign the package like
this:

<!-- FIXME EasyPG / package-x way to do this. -->
</p><pre class="example">     gpg -ba -o <var>file</var>.sig <var>file</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For a single-file package, <var>file</var> is the package Lisp file;
for a multi-file package, it is the package tar file. 
You can also sign the archive's contents file in the same way. 
Make the <samp><span class="file">.sig</span></samp> files available in the same location as the packages. 
You should also make your public key available for people to download;
e.g., by uploading it to a key server such as <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/">http://pgp.mit.edu/</a>. 
When people install packages from your archive, they can use
your public key to verify the signatures.

   </p><p>A full explanation of these matters is outside the scope of this
manual.  For more information on cryptographic keys and signing,
see <a href="../gnupg/index.html#Top">GnuPG</a>.  Emacs comes
with an interface to GNU Privacy Guard, see <a href="../epa/index.html#Top">EasyPG</a>.
