<h3 class="section">5.1 Lists and Cons Cells</h3>

<p><a name="index-lists-and-cons-cells-302"></a>
  Lists in Lisp are not a primitive data type; they are built up from
<dfn>cons cells</dfn> (see <a href="Cons-Cell-Type.html#Cons-Cell-Type">Cons Cell Type</a>).  A cons cell is a data
object that represents an ordered pair.  That is, it has two slots,
and each slot <dfn>holds</dfn>, or <dfn>refers to</dfn>, some Lisp object.  One
slot is known as the <span class="sc">car</span>, and the other is known as the <span class="sc">cdr</span>. 
(These names are traditional; see <a href="Cons-Cell-Type.html#Cons-Cell-Type">Cons Cell Type</a>.)  <span class="sc">cdr</span> is
pronounced &ldquo;could-er&rdquo;.

   <p>We say that &ldquo;the <span class="sc">car</span> of this cons cell is&rdquo; whatever object
its <span class="sc">car</span> slot currently holds, and likewise for the <span class="sc">cdr</span>.

   <p>A list is a series of cons cells &ldquo;chained together&rdquo;, so that each
cell refers to the next one.  There is one cons cell for each element
of the list.  By convention, the <span class="sc">car</span>s of the cons cells hold the
elements of the list, and the <span class="sc">cdr</span>s are used to chain the list
(this asymmetry between <span class="sc">car</span> and <span class="sc">cdr</span> is entirely a matter of
convention; at the level of cons cells, the <span class="sc">car</span> and <span class="sc">cdr</span>
slots have similar properties).  Hence, the <span class="sc">cdr</span> slot of each cons
cell in a list refers to the following cons cell.

   <p><a name="index-true-list-303"></a>  Also by convention, the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the last cons cell in a list is
<code>nil</code>.  We call such a <code>nil</code>-terminated structure a
<dfn>true list</dfn>.  In Emacs Lisp, the symbol <code>nil</code> is both a
symbol and a list with no elements.  For convenience, the symbol
<code>nil</code> is considered to have <code>nil</code> as its <span class="sc">cdr</span> (and also
as its <span class="sc">car</span>).

   <p>Hence, the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a true list is always a true list.  The
<span class="sc">cdr</span> of a nonempty true list is a true list containing all the
elements except the first.

   <p><a name="index-dotted-list-304"></a><a name="index-circular-list-305"></a>  If the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list's last cons cell is some value other than
<code>nil</code>, we call the structure a <dfn>dotted list</dfn>, since its
printed representation would use dotted pair notation (see <a href="Dotted-Pair-Notation.html#Dotted-Pair-Notation">Dotted Pair Notation</a>).  There is one other possibility: some cons cell's
<span class="sc">cdr</span> could point to one of the previous cons cells in the list. 
We call that structure a <dfn>circular list</dfn>.

   <p>For some purposes, it does not matter whether a list is true,
circular or dotted.  If a program doesn't look far enough down the
list to see the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the final cons cell, it won't care. 
However, some functions that operate on lists demand true lists and
signal errors if given a dotted list.  Most functions that try to find
the end of a list enter infinite loops if given a circular list.

   <p><a name="index-list-structure-306"></a>  Because most cons cells are used as part of lists, we refer to any
structure made out of cons cells as a <dfn>list structure</dfn>.
