<h4 class="subsection">37.17.11 Image Cache</h4>

<p><a name="index-image-cache-4035"></a>
  Emacs caches images so that it can display them again more
efficiently.  When Emacs displays an image, it searches the image
cache for an existing image specification <code>equal</code> to the desired
specification.  If a match is found, the image is displayed from the
cache.  Otherwise, Emacs loads the image normally.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/image%2Dflush"></a><a name="DASH-1056"></a>— Function: <b>image-flush</b><var> spec &amp;optional frame<a name="index-image_002dflush-4036"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function removes the image with specification <var>spec</var> from the
image cache of frame <var>frame</var>.  Image specifications are compared
using <code>equal</code>.  If <var>frame</var> is <code>nil</code>, it defaults to the
selected frame.  If <var>frame</var> is <code>t</code>, the image is flushed on
all existing frames.

        </p><p>In Emacs's current implementation, each graphical terminal possesses an
image cache, which is shared by all the frames on that terminal
(see <a href="Multiple-Terminals.html#Multiple-Terminals">Multiple Terminals</a>).  Thus, refreshing an image in one frame
also refreshes it in all other frames on the same terminal. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>One use for <code>image-flush</code> is to tell Emacs about a change in an
image file.  If an image specification contains a <code>:file</code>
property, the image is cached based on the file's contents when the
image is first displayed.  Even if the file subsequently changes,
Emacs continues displaying the old version of the image.  Calling
<code>image-flush</code> flushes the image from the cache, forcing Emacs to
re-read the file the next time it needs to display that image.

   </p><p>Another use for <code>image-flush</code> is for memory conservation.  If
your Lisp program creates a large number of temporary images over a
period much shorter than <code>image-cache-eviction-delay</code> (see
below), you can opt to flush unused images yourself, instead of
waiting for Emacs to do it automatically.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/clear%2Dimage%2Dcache"></a><a name="DASH-1057"></a>— Function: <b>clear-image-cache</b><var> &amp;optional filter<a name="index-clear_002dimage_002dcache-4037"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function clears an image cache, removing all the images stored in
it.  If <var>filter</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, it clears the cache for
the selected frame.  If <var>filter</var> is a frame, it clears the cache
for that frame.  If <var>filter</var> is <code>t</code>, all image caches are
cleared.  Otherwise, <var>filter</var> is taken to be a file name, and all
images associated with that file name are removed from all image
caches. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If an image in the image cache has not been displayed for a specified
period of time, Emacs removes it from the cache and frees the
associated memory.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/image%2Dcache%2Deviction%2Ddelay"></a><a name="DASH-1058"></a>— Variable: <b>image-cache-eviction-delay</b><var><a name="index-image_002dcache_002deviction_002ddelay-4038"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable specifies the number of seconds an image can remain in
the cache without being displayed.  When an image is not displayed for
this length of time, Emacs removes it from the image cache.

        </p><p>Under some circumstances, if the number of images in the cache grows
too large, the actual eviction delay may be shorter than this.

        </p><p>If the value is <code>nil</code>, Emacs does not remove images from the cache
except when you explicitly clear it.  This mode can be useful for
debugging. 
</p></blockquote></div>
