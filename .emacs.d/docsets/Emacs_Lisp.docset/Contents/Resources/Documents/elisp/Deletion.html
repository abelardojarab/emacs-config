<h3 class="section">31.6 Deleting Text</h3>

<p><a name="index-text-deletion-2912"></a>
<a name="index-deleting-text-vs-killing-2913"></a>  Deletion means removing part of the text in a buffer, without saving
it in the kill ring (see <a href="The-Kill-Ring.html#The-Kill-Ring">The Kill Ring</a>).  Deleted text can't be
yanked, but can be reinserted using the undo mechanism (see <a href="Undo.html#Undo">Undo</a>). 
Some deletion functions do save text in the kill ring in some special
cases.

   </p><p>All of the deletion functions operate on the current buffer.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/erase%2Dbuffer"></a><a name="DASH-686"></a>— Command: <b>erase-buffer</b><var><a name="index-erase_002dbuffer-2914"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function deletes the entire text of the current buffer
(<em>not</em> just the accessible portion), leaving it
empty.  If the buffer is read-only, it signals a <code>buffer-read-only</code>
error; if some of the text in it is read-only, it signals a
<code>text-read-only</code> error.  Otherwise, it deletes the text without
asking for any confirmation.  It returns <code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>Normally, deleting a large amount of text from a buffer inhibits further
auto-saving of that buffer “because it has shrunk”.  However,
<code>erase-buffer</code> does not do this, the idea being that the future
text is not really related to the former text, and its size should not
be compared with that of the former text.
