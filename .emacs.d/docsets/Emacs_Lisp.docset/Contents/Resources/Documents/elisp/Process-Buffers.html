<h4 class="subsection">36.9.1 Process Buffers</h4>

<p>A process can (and usually does) have an <dfn>associated buffer</dfn>,
which is an ordinary Emacs buffer that is used for two purposes: storing
the output from the process, and deciding when to kill the process.  You
can also use the buffer to identify a process to operate on, since in
normal practice only one process is associated with any given buffer. 
Many applications of processes also use the buffer for editing input to
be sent to the process, but this is not built into Emacs Lisp.

   </p><p>By default, process output is inserted in the associated buffer. 
(You can change this by defining a custom filter function,
see <a href="Filter-Functions.html#Filter-Functions">Filter Functions</a>.)  The position to insert the output is
determined by the <code>process-mark</code>, which is then updated to point
to the end of the text just inserted.  Usually, but not always, the
<code>process-mark</code> is at the end of the buffer.

   </p><p><a name="index-process_002dkill_002dbuffer_002dquery_002dfunction-3652"></a>  Killing the associated buffer of a process also kills the process. 
Emacs asks for confirmation first, if the process's
<code>process-query-on-exit-flag</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (see <a href="Query-Before-Exit.html#Query-Before-Exit">Query Before Exit</a>).  This confirmation is done by the function
<code>process-kill-buffer-query-function</code>, which is run from
<code>kill-buffer-query-functions</code> (see <a href="Killing-Buffers.html#Killing-Buffers">Killing Buffers</a>).

<blockquote><p>This function returns the process marker for <var>process</var>, which is the
marker that says where to insert output from the process.

        </p><p>If <var>process</var> does not have a buffer, <code>process-mark</code> returns a
marker that points nowhere.

        </p><p>The default filter function uses this marker to decide where to
insert process output, and updates it to point after the inserted text. 
That is why successive batches of output are inserted consecutively.

        </p><p>Custom filter functions normally should use this marker in the same fashion. 
For an example of a filter function that uses <code>process-mark</code>,
see <a href="Process-Filter-Example.html#Process-Filter-Example">Process Filter Example</a>.

        </p><p>When the user is expected to enter input in the process buffer for
transmission to the process, the process marker separates the new input
from previous output.

specified by <var>buffer-or-name</var>.  If there are several processes
associated with it, this function chooses one (currently, the one most
recently created, but don't count on that).  Deletion of a process
(see <code>delete-process</code>) makes it ineligible for this function to
return.

        </p><p>It is usually a bad idea to have more than one process associated with
the same buffer.
