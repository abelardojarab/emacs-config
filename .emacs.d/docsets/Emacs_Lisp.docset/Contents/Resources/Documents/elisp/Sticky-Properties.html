<h4 class="subsection">31.19.6 Stickiness of Text Properties</h4>
<a name="index-sticky-text-properties"></a>
<a name="index-inheritance_002c-text-property"></a>

<p>Self-inserting characters, the ones that get inserted into a buffer
when the user types them (see <a href="Commands-for-Insertion.html#Commands-for-Insertion">Commands for Insertion</a>), normally
take on the same properties as the preceding character.  This is
called <em>inheritance</em> of properties.
</p>
<p>By contrast, a Lisp program can do insertion with inheritance or without,
depending on the choice of insertion primitive.  The ordinary text
insertion functions, such as <code>insert</code>, do not inherit any
properties.  They insert text with precisely the properties of the
string being inserted, and no others.  This is correct for programs
that copy text from one context to another—for example, into or out
of the kill ring.  To insert with inheritance, use the special
primitives described in this section.  Self-inserting characters
inherit properties because they work using these primitives.
</p>
<p>When you do insertion with inheritance, <em>which</em> properties are
inherited, and from where, depends on which properties are <em>sticky</em>.
Insertion after a character inherits those of its properties that are
<em>rear-sticky</em>.  Insertion before a character inherits those of its
properties that are <em>front-sticky</em>.  When both sides offer different
sticky values for the same property, the previous character’s value
takes precedence.
</p>
<p>By default, a text property is rear-sticky but not front-sticky; thus,
the default is to inherit all the properties of the preceding character,
and nothing from the following character.
</p>
<p>You can control the stickiness of various text properties with two
specific text properties, <code>front-sticky</code> and <code>rear-nonsticky</code>,
and with the variable <code>text-property-default-nonsticky</code>.  You can
use the variable to specify a different default for a given property.
You can use those two text properties to make any specific properties
sticky or nonsticky in any particular part of the text.
</p>
<p>If a character’s <code>front-sticky</code> property is <code>t</code>, then all
its properties are front-sticky.  If the <code>front-sticky</code> property is
a list, then the sticky properties of the character are those whose
names are in the list.  For example, if a character has a
<code>front-sticky</code> property whose value is <code>(face read-only)</code>,
then insertion before the character can inherit its <code>face</code> property
and its <code>read-only</code> property, but no others.
</p>
<p>The <code>rear-nonsticky</code> property works the opposite way.  Most
properties are rear-sticky by default, so the <code>rear-nonsticky</code>
property says which properties are <em>not</em> rear-sticky.  If a
character’s <code>rear-nonsticky</code> property is <code>t</code>, then none of its
properties are rear-sticky.  If the <code>rear-nonsticky</code> property is a
list, properties are rear-sticky <em>unless</em> their names are in the
list.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/text%2Dproperty%2Ddefault%2Dnonsticky"></a><a name="index-text_002dproperty_002ddefault_002dnonsticky"></a>Variable: <strong>text-property-default-nonsticky</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable holds an alist which defines the default rear-stickiness
of various text properties.  Each element has the form
<code>(<var>property</var> . <var>nonstickiness</var>)</code>, and it defines the
stickiness of a particular text property, <var>property</var>.
</p>
<p>If <var>nonstickiness</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this means that the property
<var>property</var> is rear-nonsticky by default.  Since all properties are
front-nonsticky by default, this makes <var>property</var> nonsticky in both
directions by default.
</p>
<p>The text properties <code>front-sticky</code> and <code>rear-nonsticky</code>, when
used, take precedence over the default <var>nonstickiness</var> specified in
<code>text-property-default-nonsticky</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Here are the functions that insert text with inheritance of properties:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/insert%2Dand%2Dinherit"></a><a name="index-insert_002dand_002dinherit"></a>Function: <strong>insert-and-inherit</strong> <em>&amp;rest strings</em></dt>
<dd><p>Insert the strings <var>strings</var>, just like the function <code>insert</code>,
but inherit any sticky properties from the adjoining text.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/insert%2Dbefore%2Dmarkers%2Dand%2Dinherit"></a><a name="index-insert_002dbefore_002dmarkers_002dand_002dinherit"></a>Function: <strong>insert-before-markers-and-inherit</strong> <em>&amp;rest strings</em></dt>
<dd><p>Insert the strings <var>strings</var>, just like the function
<code>insert-before-markers</code>, but inherit any sticky properties from the
adjoining text.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>See <a href="Insertion.html#Insertion">Insertion</a>, for the ordinary insertion functions which do not
inherit.
