<h3 class="section">2.1 Printed Representation and Read Syntax</h3>
<a name="index-printed-representation"></a>
<a name="index-read-syntax"></a>

<p>The <em>printed representation</em> of an object is the format of the
output generated by the Lisp printer (the function <code>prin1</code>) for
that object.  Every data type has a unique printed representation.
The <em>read syntax</em> of an object is the format of the input accepted
by the Lisp reader (the function <code>read</code>) for that object.  This
is not necessarily unique; many kinds of object have more than one
syntax.  See <a href="Read-and-Print.html#Read-and-Print">Read and Print</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-hash-notation"></a>
<p>In most cases, an object&rsquo;s printed representation is also a read
syntax for the object.  However, some types have no read syntax, since
it does not make sense to enter objects of these types as constants in
a Lisp program.  These objects are printed in <em>hash notation</em>,
which consists of the characters &lsquo;<samp>#&lt;</samp>&rsquo;, a descriptive string
(typically the type name followed by the name of the object), and a
closing &lsquo;<samp>&gt;</samp>&rsquo;.  For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(current-buffer)
     &rArr; #&lt;buffer objects.texi&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Hash notation cannot be read at all, so the Lisp reader signals the
error <code>invalid-read-syntax</code> whenever it encounters &lsquo;<samp>#&lt;</samp>&rsquo;.
<a name="index-invalid_002dread_002dsyntax"></a>
</p>
<p>In other languages, an expression is text; it has no other form.  In
Lisp, an expression is primarily a Lisp object and only secondarily the
text that is the object&rsquo;s read syntax.  Often there is no need to
emphasize this distinction, but you must keep it in the back of your
mind, or you will occasionally be very confused.
</p>
<p>When you evaluate an expression interactively, the Lisp interpreter
first reads the textual representation of it, producing a Lisp object,
and then evaluates that object (see <a href="Evaluation.html#Evaluation">Evaluation</a>).  However,
evaluation and reading are separate activities.  Reading returns the
Lisp object represented by the text that is read; the object may or may
not be evaluated later.  See <a href="Input-Functions.html#Input-Functions">Input Functions</a>, for a description of
<code>read</code>, the basic function for reading objects.
