<h3 class="section">24.2 Saving Buffers</h3>

<p><a name="index-saving-buffers-1904"></a>
  When you edit a file in Emacs, you are actually working on a buffer
that is visiting that file—that is, the contents of the file are
copied into the buffer and the copy is what you edit.  Changes to the
buffer do not change the file until you <dfn>save</dfn> the buffer, which
means copying the contents of the buffer into the file.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/save%2Dbuffer"></a><a name="DASH-1798"></a>— Command: <b>save-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional backup-option<a name="index-save_002dbuffer-1905"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function saves the contents of the current buffer in its visited
file if the buffer has been modified since it was last visited or saved. 
Otherwise it does nothing.

        </p><p><code>save-buffer</code> is responsible for making backup files.  Normally,
<var>backup-option</var> is <code>nil</code>, and <code>save-buffer</code> makes a backup
file only if this is the first save since visiting the file.  Other
values for <var>backup-option</var> request the making of backup files in
other circumstances:

          </p><ul>
<li>With an argument of 4 or 64, reflecting 1 or 3 <kbd>C-u</kbd>'s, the
<code>save-buffer</code> function marks this version of the file to be
backed up when the buffer is next saved.

          </li><li>With an argument of 16 or 64, reflecting 2 or 3 <kbd>C-u</kbd>'s, the
<code>save-buffer</code> function unconditionally backs up the previous
version of the file before saving it.

          </li><li>With an argument of 0, unconditionally do <em>not</em> make any backup file. 
</li></ul>
        <p></p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/save%2Dsome%2Dbuffers"></a><a name="DASH-1799"></a>— Command: <b>save-some-buffers</b><var> &amp;optional save-silently-p pred<a name="index-save_002dsome_002dbuffers-1906"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="Definition-of-save_002dsome_002dbuffers"></a>This command saves some modified file-visiting buffers.  Normally it
asks the user about each buffer.  But if <var>save-silently-p</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, it saves all the file-visiting buffers without querying
the user.

        </p><p>The optional <var>pred</var> argument controls which buffers to ask about
(or to save silently if <var>save-silently-p</var> is non-<code>nil</code>). 
If it is <code>nil</code>, that means to ask only about file-visiting buffers. 
If it is <code>t</code>, that means also offer to save certain other non-file
buffers—those that have a non-<code>nil</code> buffer-local value of
<code>buffer-offer-save</code> (see <a href="Killing-Buffers.html#Killing-Buffers">Killing Buffers</a>).  A user who says
‘<samp><span class="samp">yes</span></samp>’ to saving a non-file buffer is asked to specify the file
name to use.  The <code>save-buffers-kill-emacs</code> function passes the
value <code>t</code> for <var>pred</var>.

        </p><p>If <var>pred</var> is neither <code>t</code> nor <code>nil</code>, then it should be
a function of no arguments.  It will be called in each buffer to decide
whether to offer to save that buffer.  If it returns a non-<code>nil</code>
value in a certain buffer, that means do offer to save that buffer.

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/write%2Dfile"></a><a name="DASH-1800"></a>— Command: <b>write-file</b><var> filename &amp;optional confirm<a name="index-write_002dfile-1907"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="Definition-of-write_002dfile"></a>This function writes the current buffer into file <var>filename</var>, makes
the buffer visit that file, and marks it not modified.  Then it renames
the buffer based on <var>filename</var>, appending a string like ‘<samp><span class="samp">&lt;2&gt;</span></samp>’
if necessary to make a unique buffer name.  It does most of this work by
calling <code>set-visited-file-name</code> (see <a href="Buffer-File-Name.html#Buffer-File-Name">Buffer File Name</a>) and
<code>save-buffer</code>.

        </p><p>If <var>confirm</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, that means to ask for confirmation
before overwriting an existing file.  Interactively, confirmation is
required, unless the user supplies a prefix argument.

        </p><p>If <var>filename</var> is an existing directory, or a symbolic link to one,
<code>write-file</code> uses the name of the visited file, in directory
<var>filename</var>.  If the buffer is not visiting a file, it uses the
buffer name instead. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Saving a buffer runs several hooks.  It also performs format
conversion (see <a href="Format-Conversion.html#Format-Conversion">Format Conversion</a>).

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/write%2Dfile%2Dfunctions"></a><a name="DASH-1801"></a>— Variable: <b>write-file-functions</b><var><a name="index-write_002dfile_002dfunctions-1908"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is a list of functions to be called before
writing out a buffer to its visited file.  If one of them returns
non-<code>nil</code>, the file is considered already written and the rest of
the functions are not called, nor is the usual code for writing the file
executed.

        </p><p>If a function in <code>write-file-functions</code> returns non-<code>nil</code>, it
is responsible for making a backup file (if that is appropriate). 
To do so, execute the following code:

     </p><pre class="example">          (or buffer-backed-up (backup-buffer))
</pre>
        <p>You might wish to save the file modes value returned by
<code>backup-buffer</code> and use that (if non-<code>nil</code>) to set the mode
bits of the file that you write.  This is what <code>save-buffer</code>
normally does. See <a href="Making-Backups.html#Making-Backups">Making Backup Files</a>.

        </p><p>The hook functions in <code>write-file-functions</code> are also responsible
for encoding the data (if desired): they must choose a suitable coding
system and end-of-line conversion (see <a href="Lisp-and-Coding-Systems.html#Lisp-and-Coding-Systems">Lisp and Coding Systems</a>),
perform the encoding (see <a href="Explicit-Encoding.html#Explicit-Encoding">Explicit Encoding</a>), and set
<code>last-coding-system-used</code> to the coding system that was used
(see <a href="Encoding-and-I_002fO.html#Encoding-and-I_002fO">Encoding and I/O</a>).

        </p><p>If you set this hook locally in a buffer, it is assumed to be
associated with the file or the way the contents of the buffer were
obtained.  Thus the variable is marked as a permanent local, so that
changing the major mode does not alter a buffer-local value.  On the
other hand, calling <code>set-visited-file-name</code> will reset it. 
If this is not what you want, you might like to use
<code>write-contents-functions</code> instead.

        </p><p>Even though this is not a normal hook, you can use <code>add-hook</code> and
<code>remove-hook</code> to manipulate the list.  See <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

<blockquote><p>This works just like <code>write-file-functions</code>, but it is intended
for hooks that pertain to the buffer's contents, not to the particular
visited file or its location.  Such hooks are usually set up by major
modes, as buffer-local bindings for this variable.  This variable
automatically becomes buffer-local whenever it is set; switching to a
new major mode always resets this variable, but calling
<code>set-visited-file-name</code> does not.

        </p><p>If any of the functions in this hook returns non-<code>nil</code>, the file
is considered already written and the rest are not called and neither
are the functions in <code>write-file-functions</code>.

<blockquote><p>This normal hook runs before a buffer is saved in its visited file,
regardless of whether that is done normally or by one of the hooks
described above.  For instance, the <samp><span class="file">copyright.el</span></samp> program uses
this hook to make sure the file you are saving has the current year in
its copyright notice.

<blockquote><p>This normal hook runs after a buffer has been saved in its visited file. 
One use of this hook is in Fast Lock mode; it uses this hook to save the
highlighting information in a cache file.

<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, then <code>save-buffer</code> protects
against I/O errors while saving by writing the new file to a temporary
name instead of the name it is supposed to have, and then renaming it to
the intended name after it is clear there are no errors.  This procedure
prevents problems such as a lack of disk space from resulting in an
invalid file.

        </p><p>As a side effect, backups are necessarily made by copying.  See <a href="Rename-or-Copy.html#Rename-or-Copy">Rename or Copy</a>.  Yet, at the same time, saving a precious file always breaks
all hard links between the file you save and other file names.

        </p><p>Some modes give this variable a non-<code>nil</code> buffer-local value
in particular buffers.

<blockquote><p>This variable determines whether files may be written out that do
<em>not</em> end with a newline.  If the value of the variable is
<code>t</code>, then <code>save-buffer</code> silently adds a newline at the end
of the buffer whenever it does not already end in one.  If the value
is <code>visit</code>, Emacs adds a missing newline just after it visits the
file.  If the value is <code>visit-save</code>, Emacs adds a missing newline
both on visiting and on saving.  For any other non-<code>nil</code> value,
<code>save-buffer</code> asks the user whether to add a newline each time
the case arises.

        </p><p>If the value of the variable is <code>nil</code>, then <code>save-buffer</code>
doesn't add newlines at all.  <code>nil</code> is the default value, but a few
major modes set it to <code>t</code> in particular buffers.
