<h3 class="section">27.18 Windows and Point</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-position-2417"></a><a name="index-window-point-2418"></a><a name="index-position-in-window-2419"></a><a name="index-point-in-window-2420"></a>
  Each window has its own value of point (see <a href="Point.html#Point">Point</a>), independent of
the value of point in other windows displaying the same buffer.  This
makes it useful to have multiple windows showing one buffer.

     </p><ul>
<li>The window point is established when a window is first created; it is
initialized from the buffer's point, or from the window point of another
window opened on the buffer if such a window exists.

     </li><li>Selecting a window sets the value of point in its buffer from the
window's value of point.  Conversely, deselecting a window sets the
window's value of point from that of the buffer.  Thus, when you switch
between windows that display a given buffer, the point value for the
selected window is in effect in the buffer, while the point values for
the other windows are stored in those windows.

     </li><li>As long as the selected window displays the current buffer, the window's
point and the buffer's point always move together; they remain equal. 
</li></ul>

   <p><a name="index-cursor-2421"></a>   As far as the user is concerned, point is where the cursor is, and
when the user switches to another buffer, the cursor jumps to the
position of point in that buffer.

<blockquote><p>This function returns the current position of point in <var>window</var>. 
For a nonselected window, this is the value point would have (in that
window's buffer) if that window were selected.  The default for
<var>window</var> is the selected window.

        </p><p>When <var>window</var> is the selected window, the value returned is the
value of point in that window's buffer.  Strictly speaking, it would be
more correct to return the “top-level” value of point, outside of any
<code>save-excursion</code> forms.  But that value is hard to find.
