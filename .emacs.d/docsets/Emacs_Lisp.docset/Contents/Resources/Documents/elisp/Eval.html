<h3 class="section">9.5 Eval</h3>

<p>Most often, forms are evaluated automatically, by virtue of their
occurrence in a program being run.  On rare occasions, you may need to
write code that evaluates a form that is computed at run time, such as
after reading a form from text being edited or getting one from a
property list.  On these occasions, use the <code>eval</code> function. 
Often <code>eval</code> is not needed and something else should be used instead. 
For example, to get the value of a variable, while <code>eval</code> works,
<code>symbol-value</code> is preferable; or rather than store expressions
in a property list that then need to go through <code>eval</code>, it is better to
store functions instead that are then passed to <code>funcall</code>.

   </p><p>The functions and variables described in this section evaluate forms,
specify limits to the evaluation process, or record recently returned
values.  Loading a file also does evaluation (see <a href="Loading.html#Loading">Loading</a>).

   </p><p>It is generally cleaner and more flexible to store a function in a
data structure, and call it with <code>funcall</code> or <code>apply</code>, than
to store an expression in the data structure and evaluate it.  Using
functions provides the ability to pass information to them as
arguments.

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/eval"></a><a name="DASH-809"></a>— Function: <b>eval</b><var> form &amp;optional lexical<a name="index-eval-548"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is the basic function for evaluating an expression.  It evaluates
<var>form</var> in the current environment, and returns the result.  The
type of the <var>form</var> object determines how it is evaluated. 
See <a href="Forms.html#Forms">Forms</a>.

        </p><p>The argument <var>lexical</var> specifies the scoping rule for local
variables (see <a href="Variable-Scoping.html#Variable-Scoping">Variable Scoping</a>).  If it is omitted or <code>nil</code>,
that means to evaluate <var>form</var> using the default dynamic scoping
rule.  If it is <code>t</code>, that means to use the lexical scoping rule. 
The value of <var>lexical</var> can also be a non-empty alist specifying a
particular <dfn>lexical environment</dfn> for lexical bindings; however,
this feature is only useful for specialized purposes, such as in Emacs
Lisp debuggers.  See <a href="Lexical-Binding.html#Lexical-Binding">Lexical Binding</a>.

        </p><p>Since <code>eval</code> is a function, the argument expression that appears
in a call to <code>eval</code> is evaluated twice: once as preparation before
<code>eval</code> is called, and again by the <code>eval</code> function itself. 
Here is an example:

     </p><pre class="example">          (setq foo 'bar)
               ⇒ bar
          (setq bar 'baz)
               ⇒ baz
          ;; <span class="roman">Here </span><code>eval</code><span class="roman"> receives argument </span><code>foo</code>
          (eval 'foo)
               ⇒ bar
          ;; <span class="roman">Here </span><code>eval</code><span class="roman"> receives argument </span><code>bar</code><span class="roman">, which is the value of </span><code>foo</code>
          (eval foo)
               ⇒ baz
</pre>
        <p>The number of currently active calls to <code>eval</code> is limited to
<code>max-lisp-eval-depth</code> (see below). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/eval%2Dregion"></a><a name="DASH-810"></a>— Command: <b>eval-region</b><var> start end &amp;optional stream read-function<a name="index-eval_002dregion-549"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="Definition-of-eval_002dregion"></a>This function evaluates the forms in the current buffer in the region
defined by the positions <var>start</var> and <var>end</var>.  It reads forms from
the region and calls <code>eval</code> on them until the end of the region is
reached, or until an error is signaled and not handled.

        </p><p>By default, <code>eval-region</code> does not produce any output.  However,
if <var>stream</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, any output produced by output
functions (see <a href="Output-Functions.html#Output-Functions">Output Functions</a>), as well as the values that
result from evaluating the expressions in the region are printed using
<var>stream</var>.  See <a href="Output-Streams.html#Output-Streams">Output Streams</a>.

        </p><p>If <var>read-function</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it should be a function,
which is used instead of <code>read</code> to read expressions one by one. 
This function is called with one argument, the stream for reading
input.  You can also use the variable <code>load-read-function</code>
(see <a href="Definition-of-load_002dread_002dfunction.html#Definition-of-load_002dread_002dfunction">How Programs Do Loading</a>)
to specify this function, but it is more robust to use the
<var>read-function</var> argument.

        </p><p><code>eval-region</code> does not move point.  It always returns <code>nil</code>.

<blockquote><p>This is similar to <code>eval-region</code>, but the arguments provide
different optional features.  <code>eval-buffer</code> operates on the
entire accessible portion of buffer <var>buffer-or-name</var>. 
<var>buffer-or-name</var> can be a buffer, a buffer name (a string), or
<code>nil</code> (or omitted), which means to use the current buffer. 
<var>stream</var> is used as in <code>eval-region</code>, unless <var>stream</var> is
<code>nil</code> and <var>print</var> non-<code>nil</code>.  In that case, values that
result from evaluating the expressions are still discarded, but the
output of the output functions is printed in the echo area. 
<var>filename</var> is the file name to use for <code>load-history</code>
(see <a href="Unloading.html#Unloading">Unloading</a>), and defaults to <code>buffer-file-name</code>
(see <a href="Buffer-File-Name.html#Buffer-File-Name">Buffer File Name</a>).  If <var>unibyte</var> is non-<code>nil</code>,
<code>read</code> converts strings to unibyte whenever possible.

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/max%2Dlisp%2Deval%2Ddepth"></a><a name="DASH-812"></a>— User Option: <b>max-lisp-eval-depth</b><var><a name="index-max_002dlisp_002deval_002ddepth-553"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="Definition-of-max_002dlisp_002deval_002ddepth"></a>This variable defines the maximum depth allowed in calls to <code>eval</code>,
<code>apply</code>, and <code>funcall</code> before an error is signaled (with error
message <code>"Lisp nesting exceeds max-lisp-eval-depth"</code>).

        </p><p>This limit, with the associated error when it is exceeded, is one way
Emacs Lisp avoids infinite recursion on an ill-defined function.  If
you increase the value of <code>max-lisp-eval-depth</code> too much, such
code can cause stack overflow instead. 
<a name="index-Lisp-nesting-error-554"></a>
The depth limit counts internal uses of <code>eval</code>, <code>apply</code>, and
<code>funcall</code>, such as for calling the functions mentioned in Lisp
expressions, and recursive evaluation of function call arguments and
function body forms, as well as explicit calls in Lisp code.

        </p><p>The default value of this variable is 400.  If you set it to a value
less than 100, Lisp will reset it to 100 if the given value is
reached.  Entry to the Lisp debugger increases the value, if there is
little room left, to make sure the debugger itself has room to
execute.

        </p><p><code>max-specpdl-size</code> provides another limit on nesting. 
See <a href="Definition-of-max_002dspecpdl_002dsize.html#Definition-of-max_002dspecpdl_002dsize">Local Variables</a>.

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/values"></a><a name="DASH-813"></a>— Variable: <b>values</b><var><a name="index-values-555"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is a list of the values returned by all the
expressions that were read, evaluated, and printed from buffers
(including the minibuffer) by the standard Emacs commands which do
this.  (Note that this does <em>not</em> include evaluation in
<samp><span class="file">*ielm*</span></samp> buffers, nor evaluation using <kbd>C-j</kbd> in
<code>lisp-interaction-mode</code>.)  The elements are ordered most recent
first.

     </p><pre class="example">          (setq x 1)
               ⇒ 1
          (list 'A (1+ 2) auto-save-default)

          values
               ⇒ ((A 3 t) 1 ...)
</pre>
        <p>This variable is useful for referring back to values of forms recently
evaluated.  It is generally a bad idea to print the value of
<code>values</code> itself, since this may be very long.  Instead, examine
particular elements, like this:

     </p><pre class="example">          ;; <span class="roman">Refer to the most recent evaluation result.</span>
          (nth 0 values)
               ⇒ (A 3 t)
          ;; <span class="roman">That put a new element on,</span>
          ;;   <span class="roman">so all elements move back one.</span>
          (nth 1 values)
               ⇒ (A 3 t)
          ;; <span class="roman">This gets the element that was next-to-most-recent</span>
          ;;   <span class="roman">before this example.</span>
          (nth 3 values)
               ⇒ 1
