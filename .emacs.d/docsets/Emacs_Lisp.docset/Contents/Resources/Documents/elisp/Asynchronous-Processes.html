<h3 class="section">36.4 Creating an Asynchronous Process</h3>

<p><a name="index-asynchronous-subprocess-3606"></a>
  In this section, we describe how to create an <dfn>asynchronous
process</dfn>.  After an asynchronous process is created, it runs in
parallel with Emacs, and Emacs can communicate with it using the
functions described in the following sections (see <a href="Input-to-Processes.html#Input-to-Processes">Input to Processes</a>, and see <a href="Output-from-Processes.html#Output-from-Processes">Output from Processes</a>).  Note that process
communication is only partially asynchronous: Emacs sends data to the
process only when certain functions are called, and Emacs accepts data
from the process only while waiting for input or for a time delay.

   </p><p><a name="index-pty-3607"></a><a name="index-pipe-3608"></a>  An asynchronous process is controlled either via a <dfn>pty</dfn>
(pseudo-terminal) or a <dfn>pipe</dfn>.  The choice of pty or pipe is made
when creating the process, based on the value of the variable
<code>process-connection-type</code> (see below).  Ptys are usually
preferable for processes visible to the user, as in Shell mode,
because they allow for job control (<kbd>C-c</kbd>, <kbd>C-z</kbd>, etc.) 
between the process and its children, whereas pipes do not.  For
subprocesses used for internal purposes by programs, it is often
better to use a pipe, because they are more efficient, and because
they are immune to stray character injections that ptys introduce for
large (around 500 byte) messages.  Also, the total number of ptys is
limited on many systems and it is good not to waste them.

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/start%2Dprocess"></a><a name="DASH-125"></a>— Function: <b>start-process</b><var> name buffer-or-name program &amp;rest args<a name="index-start_002dprocess-3609"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function creates a new asynchronous subprocess and starts the
program <var>program</var> running in it.  It returns a process object that
stands for the new subprocess in Lisp.  The argument <var>name</var>
specifies the name for the process object; if a process with this name
already exists, then <var>name</var> is modified (by appending ‘<samp><span class="samp">&lt;1&gt;</span></samp>’,
etc.) to be unique.  The buffer <var>buffer-or-name</var> is the buffer to
associate with the process.

        </p><p>If <var>program</var> is <code>nil</code>, Emacs opens a new pseudoterminal (pty)
and associates its input and output with <var>buffer-or-name</var>, without
creating a subprocess.  In that case, the remaining arguments
<var>args</var> are ignored.

        </p><p>The remaining arguments, <var>args</var>, are strings that specify command
line arguments for the subprocess.

        </p><p>In the example below, the first process is started and runs (rather,
sleeps) for 100 seconds (the output buffer ‘<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>’ is created
immediately).  Meanwhile, the second process is started, and
given the name ‘<samp><span class="samp">my-process&lt;1&gt;</span></samp>’ for the sake of uniqueness.  It
inserts the directory listing at the end of the buffer ‘<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>’,
before the first process finishes.  Then it finishes, and a message to
that effect is inserted in the buffer.  Much later, the first process
finishes, and another message is inserted in the buffer for it.

<blockquote><p>Like <code>start-process</code>, this function starts a new asynchronous
subprocess running <var>program</var> in it, and returns its process
object.

        </p><p>The difference from <code>start-process</code> is that this function may
invoked a file handler based on the value of <code>default-directory</code>. 
This handler ought to run <var>program</var>, perhaps on the local host,
perhaps on a remote host that corresponds to <code>default-directory</code>. 
In the latter case, the local part of <code>default-directory</code> becomes
the working directory of the process.

        </p><p>This function does not try to invoke file name handlers for
<var>program</var> or for the <var>program-args</var>.

        </p><p>Depending on the implementation of the file handler, it might not be
possible to apply <code>process-filter</code> or <code>process-sentinel</code> to
the resulting process object.  See <a href="Filter-Functions.html#Filter-Functions">Filter Functions</a>, and <a href="Sentinels.html#Sentinels">Sentinels</a>.

     <!-- FIXME  Can we find a better example (i.e., a more modern function -->
     <!-- that is actually documented). -->
        </p><p>Some file handlers may not support <code>start-file-process</code> (for
example the function <code>ange-ftp-hook-function</code>).  In such cases,
this function does nothing and returns <code>nil</code>.

<blockquote><p>This function is like <code>start-process</code>, except that it uses a shell
to execute the specified command.  The argument <var>command</var> is a shell
command name.  The variable <code>shell-file-name</code> specifies which shell to
use.

        </p><p>The point of running a program through the shell, rather than directly
with <code>start-process</code>, is so that you can employ shell features such
as wildcards in the arguments.  It follows that if you include any
arbitrary user-specified arguments in the command, you should quote them
with <code>shell-quote-argument</code> first, so that any special shell
characters do <em>not</em> have their special shell meanings.  See <a href="Shell-Arguments.html#Shell-Arguments">Shell Arguments</a>.  Of course, when executing commands based on user input
you should also consider the security implications.
