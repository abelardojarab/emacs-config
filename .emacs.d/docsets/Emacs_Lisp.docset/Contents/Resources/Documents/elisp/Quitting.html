  Typing <kbd>C-g</kbd> while a Lisp function is running causes Emacs to
<dfn>quit</dfn> whatever it is doing.  This means that control returns to the
innermost active command loop.

   </p><p>Typing <kbd>C-g</kbd> while the command loop is waiting for keyboard input
does not cause a quit; it acts as an ordinary input character.  In the
simplest case, you cannot tell the difference, because <kbd>C-g</kbd>
normally runs the command <code>keyboard-quit</code>, whose effect is to quit. 
However, when <kbd>C-g</kbd> follows a prefix key, they combine to form an
undefined key.  The effect is to cancel the prefix key as well as any
prefix argument.

   </p><p>In the minibuffer, <kbd>C-g</kbd> has a different definition: it aborts out
of the minibuffer.  This means, in effect, that it exits the minibuffer
and then quits.  (Simply quitting would return to the command loop
<em>within</em> the minibuffer.)  The reason why <kbd>C-g</kbd> does not quit
directly when the command reader is reading input is so that its meaning
can be redefined in the minibuffer in this way.  <kbd>C-g</kbd> following a
prefix key is not redefined in the minibuffer, and it has its normal
effect of canceling the prefix key and prefix argument.  This too
would not be possible if <kbd>C-g</kbd> always quit directly.

   </p><p>When <kbd>C-g</kbd> does directly quit, it does so by setting the variable
<code>quit-flag</code> to <code>t</code>.  Emacs checks this variable at appropriate
times and quits if it is not <code>nil</code>.  Setting <code>quit-flag</code>
non-<code>nil</code> in any way thus causes a quit.

   </p><p>At the level of C code, quitting cannot happen just anywhere; only at the
special places that check <code>quit-flag</code>.  The reason for this is
that quitting at other places might leave an inconsistency in Emacs's
internal state.  Because quitting is delayed until a safe place, quitting
cannot make Emacs crash.

   </p><p>Certain functions such as <code>read-key-sequence</code> or
<code>read-quoted-char</code> prevent quitting entirely even though they wait
for input.  Instead of quitting, <kbd>C-g</kbd> serves as the requested
input.  In the case of <code>read-key-sequence</code>, this serves to bring
about the special behavior of <kbd>C-g</kbd> in the command loop.  In the
case of <code>read-quoted-char</code>, this is so that <kbd>C-q</kbd> can be used
to quote a <kbd>C-g</kbd>.

   </p><p><a name="index-preventing-quitting-1468"></a>  You can prevent quitting for a portion of a Lisp function by binding
the variable <code>inhibit-quit</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  Then,
although <kbd>C-g</kbd> still sets <code>quit-flag</code> to <code>t</code> as usual, the
usual result of this—a quit—is prevented.  Eventually,
<code>inhibit-quit</code> will become <code>nil</code> again, such as when its
binding is unwound at the end of a <code>let</code> form.  At that time, if
<code>quit-flag</code> is still non-<code>nil</code>, the requested quit happens
immediately.  This behavior is ideal when you wish to make sure that
quitting does not happen within a “critical section” of the program.

   </p><p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bread_002dquoted_002dchar_007d-quitting-1469"></a>  In some functions (such as <code>read-quoted-char</code>), <kbd>C-g</kbd> is
handled in a special way that does not involve quitting.  This is done
by reading the input with <code>inhibit-quit</code> bound to <code>t</code>, and
setting <code>quit-flag</code> to <code>nil</code> before <code>inhibit-quit</code>
becomes <code>nil</code> again.  This excerpt from the definition of
<code>read-quoted-char</code> shows how this is done; it also shows that
normal quitting is permitted after the first character of input.

</p><pre class="example">     (defun read-quoted-char (&amp;optional prompt)
       "...<var>documentation</var>..."
       (let ((message-log-max nil) done (first t) (code 0) char)
         (while (not done)
           (let ((inhibit-quit first)
                 ...)
             (and prompt (message "%s-" prompt))
             (setq char (read-event))
             (if inhibit-quit (setq quit-flag nil)))
           <span class="roman">...set the variable </span><code>code</code><span class="roman">...</span>)
         code))

<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, then Emacs quits immediately, unless

<blockquote><p>This variable determines whether Emacs should quit when <code>quit-flag</code>
is set to a value other than <code>nil</code>.  If <code>inhibit-quit</code> is

<blockquote><p>This macro executes <var>body</var> forms in sequence, but allows quitting, at
least locally, within <var>body</var> even if <code>inhibit-quit</code> was
non-<code>nil</code> outside this construct.  It returns the value of the
last form in <var>body</var>, unless exited by quitting, in which case
it returns <code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>If <code>inhibit-quit</code> is <code>nil</code> on entry to <code>with-local-quit</code>,
it only executes the <var>body</var>, and setting <code>quit-flag</code> causes
a normal quit.  However, if <code>inhibit-quit</code> is non-<code>nil</code> so
that ordinary quitting is delayed, a non-<code>nil</code> <code>quit-flag</code>
triggers a special kind of local quit.  This ends the execution of
<var>body</var> and exits the <code>with-local-quit</code> body with
<code>quit-flag</code> still non-<code>nil</code>, so that another (ordinary) quit
will happen as soon as that is allowed.  If <code>quit-flag</code> is
already non-<code>nil</code> at the beginning of <var>body</var>, the local quit
happens immediately and the body doesn't execute at all.

        </p><p>This macro is mainly useful in functions that can be called from
timers, process filters, process sentinels, <code>pre-command-hook</code>,
<code>post-command-hook</code>, and other places where <code>inhibit-quit</code> is
normally bound to <code>t</code>.
