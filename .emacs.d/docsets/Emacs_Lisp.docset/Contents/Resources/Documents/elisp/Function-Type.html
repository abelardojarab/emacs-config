<h4 class="subsection">2.3.13 Function Type</h4>

<p>Lisp functions are executable code, just like functions in other
programming languages.  In Lisp, unlike most languages, functions are
also Lisp objects.  A non-compiled function in Lisp is a lambda
expression: that is, a list whose first element is the symbol
<code>lambda</code> (see <a href="Lambda-Expressions.html#Lambda-Expressions">Lambda Expressions</a>).
</p>
<p>In most programming languages, it is impossible to have a function
without a name.  In Lisp, a function has no intrinsic name.  A lambda
expression can be called as a function even though it has no name; to
emphasize this, we also call it an <em>anonymous function</em>
(see <a href="Anonymous-Functions.html#Anonymous-Functions">Anonymous Functions</a>).  A named function in Lisp is just a
symbol with a valid function in its function cell (see <a href="Defining-Functions.html#Defining-Functions">Defining Functions</a>).
</p>
<p>Most of the time, functions are called when their names are written in
Lisp expressions in Lisp programs.  However, you can construct or obtain
a function object at run time and then call it with the primitive
functions <code>funcall</code> and <code>apply</code>.  See <a href="Calling-Functions.html#Calling-Functions">Calling Functions</a>.
