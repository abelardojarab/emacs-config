<h5 class="subsubsection">17.2.15.2 Specification List</h5>

<p><a name="index-Edebug-specification-list-1044"></a>A <dfn>specification list</dfn> is required for an Edebug specification if
some arguments of a macro call are evaluated while others are not.  Some
elements in a specification list match one or more arguments, but others
modify the processing of all following elements.  The latter, called
<dfn>specification keywords</dfn>, are symbols beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; (such
as <code>&amp;optional</code>).

   <p>A specification list may contain sublists, which match arguments that are
themselves lists, or it may contain vectors used for grouping.  Sublists
and groups thus subdivide the specification list into a hierarchy of
levels.  Specification keywords apply only to the remainder of the
sublist or group they are contained in.

   <p>When a specification list involves alternatives or repetition, matching
it against an actual macro call may require backtracking.  For more
details, see <a href="Backtracking.html#Backtracking">Backtracking</a>.

   <p>Edebug specifications provide the power of regular expression matching,
plus some context-free grammar constructs: the matching of sublists with
balanced parentheses, recursive processing of forms, and recursion via
indirect specifications.

   <p>Here's a table of the possible elements of a specification list, with
their meanings (see <a href="Specification-Examples.html#Specification-Examples">Specification Examples</a>, for the referenced
examples):

     <dl>
<dt><code>sexp</code><dd>A single unevaluated Lisp object, which is not instrumented. 
<!-- an "expression" is not necessarily intended for evaluation. -->

     <br><dt><code>form</code><dd>A single evaluated expression, which is instrumented.

     <br><dt><code>place</code><dd>A generalized variable.  See <a href="Generalized-Variables.html#Generalized-Variables">Generalized Variables</a>.

     <br><dt><code>body</code><dd>Short for <code>&amp;rest form</code>.  See <code>&amp;rest</code> below.

     <br><dt><code>function-form</code><dd>A function form: either a quoted function symbol, a quoted lambda
expression, or a form (that should evaluate to a function symbol or
lambda expression).  This is useful when an argument that's a lambda
expression might be quoted with <code>quote</code> rather than
<code>function</code>, since it instruments the body of the lambda expression
either way.

     <br><dt><code>lambda-expr</code><dd>A lambda expression with no quoting.

     <br><dt><code>&amp;optional</code><dd><!-- @kindex &optional @r{(Edebug)} -->
All following elements in the specification list are optional; as soon
as one does not match, Edebug stops matching at this level.

     <p>To make just a few elements optional, followed by non-optional elements,
use <code>[&amp;optional </code><var>specs</var><code>...]</code>.  To specify that several
elements must all match or none, use <code>&amp;optional
[</code><var>specs</var><code>...]</code>.  See the <code>defun</code> example.

     <br><dt><code>&amp;rest</code><dd><!-- @kindex &rest @r{(Edebug)} -->
All following elements in the specification list are repeated zero or
more times.  In the last repetition, however, it is not a problem if the
expression runs out before matching all of the elements of the
specification list.

     <p>To repeat only a few elements, use <code>[&amp;rest </code><var>specs</var><code>...]</code>. 
To specify several elements that must all match on every repetition, use
<code>&amp;rest [</code><var>specs</var><code>...]</code>.

     <br><dt><code>&amp;or</code><dd><!-- @kindex &or @r{(Edebug)} -->
Each of the following elements in the specification list is an
alternative.  One of the alternatives must match, or the <code>&amp;or</code>
specification fails.

     <p>Each list element following <code>&amp;or</code> is a single alternative.  To
group two or more list elements as a single alternative, enclose them in
<code>[...]</code>.

     <br><dt><code>&amp;not</code><dd><!-- @kindex &not @r{(Edebug)} -->
Each of the following elements is matched as alternatives as if by using
<code>&amp;or</code>, but if any of them match, the specification fails.  If none
of them match, nothing is matched, but the <code>&amp;not</code> specification
succeeds.

     <!-- FIXME &key? -->
     <br><dt><code>&amp;define</code><dd><!-- @kindex &define @r{(Edebug)} -->
Indicates that the specification is for a defining form.  The defining
form itself is not instrumented (that is, Edebug does not stop before and
after the defining form), but forms inside it typically will be
instrumented.  The <code>&amp;define</code> keyword should be the first element in
a list specification.

     <br><dt><code>nil</code><dd>This is successful when there are no more arguments to match at the
current argument list level; otherwise it fails.  See sublist
specifications and the backquote example.

     <br><dt><code>gate</code><dd><a name="index-preventing-backtracking-1045"></a>No argument is matched but backtracking through the gate is disabled
while matching the remainder of the specifications at this level.  This
is primarily used to generate more specific syntax error messages.  See
<a href="Backtracking.html#Backtracking">Backtracking</a>, for more details.  Also see the <code>let</code> example.

     <br><dt><var>other-symbol</var><dd><a name="index-indirect-specifications-1046"></a>Any other symbol in a specification list may be a predicate or an
indirect specification.

     <p>If the symbol has an Edebug specification, this <dfn>indirect
specification</dfn> should be either a list specification that is used in
place of the symbol, or a function that is called to process the
arguments.  The specification may be defined with <code>def-edebug-spec</code>
just as for macros.  See the <code>defun</code> example.

     <p>Otherwise, the symbol should be a predicate.  The predicate is called
with the argument, and if the predicate returns <code>nil</code>, the
specification fails and the argument is not instrumented.

     <p>Some suitable predicates include <code>symbolp</code>, <code>integerp</code>,
<code>stringp</code>, <code>vectorp</code>, and <code>atom</code>.

     <br><dt><code>[</code><var>elements</var><code>...]</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_005b_0040dots_007b_007d_005d-_0028Edebug_0029-1047"></a>A vector of elements groups the elements into a single <dfn>group
specification</dfn>.  Its meaning has nothing to do with vectors.

     <br><dt><code>"</code><var>string</var><code>"</code><dd>The argument should be a symbol named <var>string</var>.  This specification
is equivalent to the quoted symbol, <code>'</code><var>symbol</var>, where the name
of <var>symbol</var> is the <var>string</var>, but the string form is preferred.

     <br><dt><code>(vector </code><var>elements</var><code>...)</code><dd>The argument should be a vector whose elements must match the
<var>elements</var> in the specification.  See the backquote example.

     <br><dt><code>(</code><var>elements</var><code>...)</code><dd>Any other list is a <dfn>sublist specification</dfn> and the argument must be
a list whose elements match the specification <var>elements</var>.

     <p><a name="index-dotted-lists-_0028Edebug_0029-1048"></a>A sublist specification may be a dotted list and the corresponding list
argument may then be a dotted list.  Alternatively, the last <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a
dotted list specification may be another sublist specification (via a
grouping or an indirect specification, e.g., <code>(spec .  [(more
specs...)])</code>) whose elements match the non-dotted list arguments. 
This is useful in recursive specifications such as in the backquote
example.  Also see the description of a <code>nil</code> specification
above for terminating such recursion.

     <p>Note that a sublist specification written as <code>(specs .  nil)</code>
is equivalent to <code>(specs)</code>, and <code>(specs . 
(sublist-elements...))</code> is equivalent to <code>(specs
sublist-elements...)</code>. 
</dl>

<!-- Need to document extensions with &symbol and :symbol -->
   <p>Here is a list of additional specifications that may appear only after
<code>&amp;define</code>.  See the <code>defun</code> example.

     <dl>
<dt><code>name</code><dd>The argument, a symbol, is the name of the defining form.

     <p>A defining form is not required to have a name field; and it may have
multiple name fields.

     <br><dt><code>:name</code><dd>This construct does not actually match an argument.  The element
following <code>:name</code> should be a symbol; it is used as an additional
name component for the definition.  You can use this to add a unique,
static component to the name of the definition.  It may be used more
than once.

     <br><dt><code>arg</code><dd>The argument, a symbol, is the name of an argument of the defining form. 
However, lambda-list keywords (symbols starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;)
are not allowed.

     <br><dt><code>lambda-list</code><dd><a name="index-lambda_002dlist-_0028Edebug_0029-1049"></a>This matches a lambda list&mdash;the argument list of a lambda expression.

     <br><dt><code>def-body</code><dd>The argument is the body of code in a definition.  This is like
<code>body</code>, described above, but a definition body must be instrumented
with a different Edebug call that looks up information associated with
the definition.  Use <code>def-body</code> for the highest level list of forms
within the definition.

     <br><dt><code>def-form</code><dd>The argument is a single, highest-level form in a definition.  This is
like <code>def-body</code>, except it is used to match a single form rather than
a list of forms.  As a special case, <code>def-form</code> also means that
tracing information is not output when the form is executed.  See the
<code>interactive</code> example.
