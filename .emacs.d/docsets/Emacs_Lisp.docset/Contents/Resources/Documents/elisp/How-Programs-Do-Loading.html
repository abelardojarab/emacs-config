<h3 class="section">15.1 How Programs Do Loading</h3>

<p>Emacs Lisp has several interfaces for loading.  For example,
<code>autoload</code> creates a placeholder object for a function defined in a
file; trying to call the autoloading function loads the file to get the
function's real definition (see <a href="Autoload.html#Autoload">Autoload</a>).  <code>require</code> loads a
file if it isn't already loaded (see <a href="Named-Features.html#Named-Features">Named Features</a>).  Ultimately,
all these facilities call the <code>load</code> function to do the work.

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/load"></a><a name="DASH-1048"></a>— Function: <b>load</b><var> filename &amp;optional missing-ok nomessage nosuffix must-suffix<a name="index-load-877"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function finds and opens a file of Lisp code, evaluates all the
forms in it, and closes the file.

        </p><p>To find the file, <code>load</code> first looks for a file named
<samp><var>filename</var><span class="file">.elc</span></samp>, that is, for a file whose name is
<var>filename</var> with the extension ‘<samp><span class="samp">.elc</span></samp>’ appended.  If such a
file exists, it is loaded.  If there is no file by that name, then
<code>load</code> looks for a file named <samp><var>filename</var><span class="file">.el</span></samp>.  If that
file exists, it is loaded.  Finally, if neither of those names is
found, <code>load</code> looks for a file named <var>filename</var> with nothing
appended, and loads it if it exists.  (The <code>load</code> function is not
clever about looking at <var>filename</var>.  In the perverse case of a
file named <samp><span class="file">foo.el.el</span></samp>, evaluation of <code>(load "foo.el")</code> will
indeed find it.)

        </p><p>If Auto Compression mode is enabled, as it is by default, then if
<code>load</code> can not find a file, it searches for a compressed version
of the file before trying other file names.  It decompresses and loads
it if it exists.  It looks for compressed versions by appending each
of the suffixes in <code>jka-compr-load-suffixes</code> to the file name. 
The value of this variable must be a list of strings. Its standard
value is <code>(".gz")</code>.

        </p><p>If the optional argument <var>nosuffix</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then
<code>load</code> does not try the suffixes ‘<samp><span class="samp">.elc</span></samp>’ and ‘<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>’.  In
this case, you must specify the precise file name you want, except
that, if Auto Compression mode is enabled, <code>load</code> will still use
<code>jka-compr-load-suffixes</code> to find compressed versions.  By
specifying the precise file name and using <code>t</code> for
<var>nosuffix</var>, you can prevent file names like <samp><span class="file">foo.el.el</span></samp> from
being tried.

        </p><p>If the optional argument <var>must-suffix</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then
<code>load</code> insists that the file name used must end in either
‘<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>’ or ‘<samp><span class="samp">.elc</span></samp>’ (possibly extended with a compression
suffix), unless it contains an explicit directory name.

        </p><p>If the option <code>load-prefer-newer</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then when
searching suffixes, <code>load</code> selects whichever version of a file
(‘<samp><span class="samp">.elc</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>’, etc.) has been modified most recently.

        </p><p>If <var>filename</var> is a relative file name, such as <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">baz/foo.bar</span></samp>, <code>load</code> searches for the file using the variable
<code>load-path</code>.  It appends <var>filename</var> to each of the directories
listed in <code>load-path</code>, and loads the first file it finds whose name
matches.  The current default directory is tried only if it is specified
in <code>load-path</code>, where <code>nil</code> stands for the default directory. 
<code>load</code> tries all three possible suffixes in the first directory in
<code>load-path</code>, then all three suffixes in the second directory, and
so on.  See <a href="Library-Search.html#Library-Search">Library Search</a>.

        </p><p>Whatever the name under which the file is eventually found, and the
directory where Emacs found it, Emacs sets the value of the variable
<code>load-file-name</code> to that file's name.

        </p><p>If you get a warning that <samp><span class="file">foo.elc</span></samp> is older than <samp><span class="file">foo.el</span></samp>, it
means you should consider recompiling <samp><span class="file">foo.el</span></samp>.  See <a href="Byte-Compilation.html#Byte-Compilation">Byte Compilation</a>.

        </p><p>When loading a source file (not compiled), <code>load</code> performs
character set translation just as Emacs would do when visiting the file. 
See <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>.

     <!-- This is referred to from the Macros chapter. -->
     <!-- Not sure if it should be the other way round. -->
        </p><p><a name="index-eager-macro-expansion-878"></a>When loading an uncompiled file, Emacs tries to expand any macros
that the file contains (see <a href="Macros.html#Macros">Macros</a>).  We refer to this as
<dfn>eager macro expansion</dfn>.  Doing this (rather than deferring
the expansion until the relevant code runs) can significantly speed
up the execution of uncompiled code.  Sometimes, this macro expansion
cannot be done, owing to a cyclic dependency.  In the simplest
example of this, the file you are loading refers to a macro defined
in another file, and that file in turn requires the file you are
loading.  This is generally harmless.  Emacs prints a warning
(‘<samp><span class="samp">Eager macro-expansion skipped due to cycle...</span></samp>’)
giving details of the problem, but it still loads the file, just
leaving the macro unexpanded for now.  You may wish to restructure
your code so that this does not happen.  Loading a compiled file does
not cause macroexpansion, because this should already have happened
during compilation.  See <a href="Compiling-Macros.html#Compiling-Macros">Compiling Macros</a>.

        </p><p>Messages like ‘<samp><span class="samp">Loading foo...</span></samp>’ and ‘<samp><span class="samp">Loading foo...done</span></samp>’ appear
in the echo area during loading unless <var>nomessage</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>.

        </p><p><a name="index-load-errors-879"></a>Any unhandled errors while loading a file terminate loading.  If the
load was done for the sake of <code>autoload</code>, any function definitions
made during the loading are undone.

        </p><p><a name="index-file_002derror-880"></a>If <code>load</code> can't find the file to load, then normally it signals the
error <code>file-error</code> (with ‘<samp><span class="samp">Cannot open load file
</span><var>filename</var></samp>’).  But if <var>missing-ok</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then
<code>load</code> just returns <code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>You can use the variable <code>load-read-function</code> to specify a function
for <code>load</code> to use instead of <code>read</code> for reading expressions. 
See below.

        </p><p><code>load</code> returns <code>t</code> if the file loads successfully.

This variable specifies an alternate expression-reading function for
<code>load</code> and <code>eval-region</code> to use instead of <code>read</code>. 
The function should accept one argument, just as <code>read</code> does.

        </p><p>Normally, the variable's value is <code>nil</code>, which means those
functions should use <code>read</code>.

        </p><p>Instead of using this variable, it is cleaner to use another, newer
feature: to pass the function as the <var>read-function</var> argument to
<code>eval-region</code>.  See <a href="Definition-of-eval_002dregion.html#Definition-of-eval_002dregion">Eval</a>.
