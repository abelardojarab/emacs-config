<h3 class="section">16.6 Compiler Errors</h3>

<p><a name="index-compiler-errors-955"></a>
  Error and warning messages from byte compilation are printed in a
buffer named <samp><span class="file">*Compile-Log*</span></samp>.  These messages include file names
and line numbers identifying the location of the problem.  The usual
Emacs commands for operating on compiler output can be used on these
messages.

   </p><p>When an error is due to invalid syntax in the program, the byte
compiler might get confused about the errors' exact location.  One way
to investigate is to switch to the buffer <samp><span class="file">&nbsp;*Compiler&nbsp;Input*</span></samp><!-- /@w -->.  (This buffer name starts with a space, so it does not show
up in the Buffer Menu.)  This buffer contains the program being
compiled, and point shows how far the byte compiler was able to read;
the cause of the error might be nearby.  See <a href="Syntax-Errors.html#Syntax-Errors">Syntax Errors</a>, for
some tips for locating syntax errors.

   </p><p>A common type of warning issued by the byte compiler is for
functions and variables that were used but not defined.  Such warnings
report the line number for the end of the file, not the locations
where the missing functions or variables were used; to find these, you
must search the file manually.

   </p><p>If you are sure that a warning message about a missing function or
variable is unjustified, there are several ways to suppress it:

     </p><ul>
<li>You can suppress the warning for a specific call to a function
<var>func</var> by conditionalizing it on an <code>fboundp</code> test, like
this:

     <pre class="example">          (if (fboundp '<var>func</var>) ...(<var>func</var> ...)...)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The call to <var>func</var> must be in the <var>then-form</var> of the
<code>if</code>, and <var>func</var> must appear quoted in the call to
<code>fboundp</code>.  (This feature operates for <code>cond</code> as well.)

     </p></li><li>Likewise, you can suppress the warning for a specific use of a
variable <var>variable</var> by conditionalizing it on a <code>boundp</code>
test:

     <pre class="example">          (if (boundp '<var>variable</var>) ...<var>variable</var>...)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The reference to <var>variable</var> must be in the <var>then-form</var> of the
<code>if</code>, and <var>variable</var> must appear quoted in the call to
<code>boundp</code>.

     </p></li><li>You can tell the compiler that a function is defined using
<code>declare-function</code>. See <a href="Declaring-Functions.html#Declaring-Functions">Declaring Functions</a>.

     </li><li>Likewise, you can tell the compiler that a variable is defined using
<code>defvar</code> with no initial value.  (Note that this marks the
variable as special.)  See <a href="Defining-Variables.html#Defining-Variables">Defining Variables</a>. 
</li></ul>

   <p>You can also suppress any and all compiler warnings within a certain
expression using the construct <code>with-no-warnings</code>:

<!-- This is implemented with a defun, but conceptually it is -->
<!-- a special form. -->
</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/with%2Dno%2Dwarnings"></a><a name="DASH-493"></a>â€” Special Form: <b>with-no-warnings</b><var> body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-with_002dno_002dwarnings-956"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>In execution, this is equivalent to <code>(progn </code><var>body</var><code>...)</code>,
but the compiler does not issue warnings for anything that occurs
inside <var>body</var>.

        </p><p>We recommend that you use this construct around the smallest
possible piece of code, to avoid missing possible warnings other than
one you intend to suppress. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Byte compiler warnings can be controlled more precisely by setting
the variable <code>byte-compile-warnings</code>.  See its documentation
string for details.
