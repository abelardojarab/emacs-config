<h4 class="subsection">22.2.6 Mode Hooks</h4>

<p>Every major mode command should finish by running the mode-independent
normal hook <code>change-major-mode-after-body-hook</code>, its mode hook,
and the normal hook <code>after-change-major-mode-hook</code>.
It does this by calling <code>run-mode-hooks</code>.  If the major mode is a
derived mode, that is if it calls another major mode (the parent mode)
in its body, it should do this inside <code>delay-mode-hooks</code> so that
the parent won’t run these hooks itself.  Instead, the derived mode’s
call to <code>run-mode-hooks</code> runs the parent’s mode hook too.
See <a href="Major-Mode-Conventions.html#Major-Mode-Conventions">Major Mode Conventions</a>.
</p>
<p>Emacs versions before Emacs 22 did not have <code>delay-mode-hooks</code>.
Versions before 24 did not have <code>change-major-mode-after-body-hook</code>.
When user-implemented major modes do not use <code>run-mode-hooks</code> and
have not been updated to use these newer features, they won’t entirely
follow these conventions: they may run the parent’s mode hook too early,
or fail to run <code>after-change-major-mode-hook</code>.  If you encounter
such a major mode, please correct it to follow these conventions.
</p>
<p>When you define a major mode using <code>define-derived-mode</code>, it
automatically makes sure these conventions are followed.  If you
define a major mode “by hand”, not using <code>define-derived-mode</code>,
use the following functions to handle these conventions automatically.

<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/func/run%2Dmode%2Dhooks"></a><a name="index-run_002dmode_002dhooks"></a>Function: <strong>run-mode-hooks</strong> <em>&amp;rest hookvars</em></dt>
<dd><p>Major modes should run their mode hook using this function.  It is
similar to <code>run-hooks</code> (see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>), but it also runs
<code>change-major-mode-after-body-hook</code> and
<code>after-change-major-mode-hook</code>.
</p>
<p>When this function is called during the execution of a
<code>delay-mode-hooks</code> form, it does not run the hooks immediately.
Instead, it arranges for the next call to <code>run-mode-hooks</code> to run
them.

<dd><p>When one major mode command calls another, it should do so inside of
<code>delay-mode-hooks</code>.
</p>
<p>This macro executes <var>body</var>, but tells all <code>run-mode-hooks</code>
calls during the execution of <var>body</var> to delay running their hooks.
The hooks will actually run during the next call to
<code>run-mode-hooks</code> after the end of the <code>delay-mode-hooks</code>
construct.
