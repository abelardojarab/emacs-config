<h3 class="section">15.10 Hooks for Loading</h3>

<p><a name="index-loading-hooks-927"></a><a name="index-hooks-for-loading-928"></a>
You can ask for code to be executed each time Emacs loads a library,
by using the variable <code>after-load-functions</code>:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/after%2Dload%2Dfunctions"></a><a name="DASH-1042"></a>— Variable: <b>after-load-functions</b><var><a name="index-after_002dload_002dfunctions-929"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This abnormal hook is run after loading a file.  Each function in the
hook is called with a single argument, the absolute filename of the
file that was just loaded. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If you want code to be executed when a <em>particular</em> library is
loaded, use the macro <code>with-eval-after-load</code>:

</p><div class="defun">
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/macro/with%2Deval%2Dafter%2Dload"></a><a name="DASH-1043"></a>— Macro: <b>with-eval-after-load</b><var> library body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-with_002deval_002dafter_002dload-930"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro arranges to evaluate <var>body</var> at the end of loading
the file <var>library</var>, each time <var>library</var> is loaded.  If
<var>library</var> is already loaded, it evaluates <var>body</var> right away.

        </p><p>You don't need to give a directory or extension in the file name
<var>library</var>.  Normally, you just give a bare file name, like this:

     </p><pre class="example">          (with-eval-after-load "edebug" (def-edebug-spec c-point t))
</pre>
        <p>To restrict which files can trigger the evaluation, include a
directory or an extension or both in <var>library</var>.  Only a file whose
absolute true name (i.e., the name with all symbolic links chased out)
matches all the given name components will match.  In the following
example, <samp><span class="file">my_inst.elc</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">my_inst.elc.gz</span></samp> in some directory
<code>..../foo/bar</code> will trigger the evaluation, but not
<samp><span class="file">my_inst.el</span></samp>:

     </p><pre class="example">          (with-eval-after-load "foo/bar/my_inst.elc" ...)
</pre>
        <p><var>library</var> can also be a feature (i.e., a symbol), in which case
<var>body</var> is evaluated at the end of any file where
<code>(provide </code><var>library</var><code>)</code> is called.

        </p><p>An error in <var>body</var> does not undo the load, but does prevent
execution of the rest of <var>body</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Normally, well-designed Lisp programs should not use
<code>eval-after-load</code>.  If you need to examine and set the variables
defined in another library (those meant for outside use), you can do
it immediately—there is no need to wait until the library is loaded. 
If you need to call functions defined by that library, you should load
the library, preferably with <code>require</code> (see <a href="Named-Features.html#Named-Features">Named Features</a>).
