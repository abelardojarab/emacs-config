<h4 class="subsection">12.2.1 Components of a Lambda Expression</h4>

<p>A lambda expression is a list that looks like this:

<pre class="example">     (lambda (<var>arg-variables</var>...)
       [<var>documentation-string</var>]
       [<var>interactive-declaration</var>]
       <var>body-forms</var>...)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-lambda-list-735"></a>  The first element of a lambda expression is always the symbol
<code>lambda</code>.  This indicates that the list represents a function.  The
reason functions are defined to start with <code>lambda</code> is so that
other lists, intended for other uses, will not accidentally be valid as
functions.

   <p>The second element is a list of symbols&mdash;the argument variable names. 
This is called the <dfn>lambda list</dfn>.  When a Lisp function is called,
the argument values are matched up against the variables in the lambda
list, which are given local bindings with the values provided. 
See <a href="Local-Variables.html#Local-Variables">Local Variables</a>.

   <p>The documentation string is a Lisp string object placed within the
function definition to describe the function for the Emacs help
facilities.  See <a href="Function-Documentation.html#Function-Documentation">Function Documentation</a>.

   <p>The interactive declaration is a list of the form <code>(interactive
</code><var>code-string</var><code>)</code>.  This declares how to provide arguments if the
function is used interactively.  Functions with this declaration are called
<dfn>commands</dfn>; they can be called using <kbd>M-x</kbd> or bound to a key. 
Functions not intended to be called in this way should not have interactive
declarations.  See <a href="Defining-Commands.html#Defining-Commands">Defining Commands</a>, for how to write an interactive
declaration.

   <p><a name="index-body-of-function-736"></a>  The rest of the elements are the <dfn>body</dfn> of the function: the Lisp
code to do the work of the function (or, as a Lisp programmer would say,
&ldquo;a list of Lisp forms to evaluate&rdquo;).  The value returned by the
function is the value returned by the last element of the body.
