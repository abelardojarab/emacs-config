<h4 class="subsection">21.17.2 Menus and the Mouse</h4>

<p>The usual way to make a menu keymap produce a menu is to make it the
definition of a prefix key.  (A Lisp program can explicitly pop up a
menu and receive the user's choice&mdash;see <a href="Pop_002dUp-Menus.html#Pop_002dUp-Menus">Pop-Up Menus</a>.)

   <p>If the prefix key ends with a mouse event, Emacs handles the menu keymap
by popping up a visible menu, so that the user can select a choice with
the mouse.  When the user clicks on a menu item, the event generated is
whatever character or symbol has the binding that brought about that
menu item.  (A menu item may generate a series of events if the menu has
multiple levels or comes from the menu bar.)

   <p>It's often best to use a button-down event to trigger the menu.  Then
the user can select a menu item by releasing the button.

   <p><a name="index-submenu-1649"></a>  If the menu keymap contains a binding to a nested keymap, the nested
keymap specifies a <dfn>submenu</dfn>.  There will be a menu item, labeled
by the nested keymap's item string, and clicking on this item
automatically pops up the specified submenu.  As a special exception,
if the menu keymap contains a single nested keymap and no other menu
items, the menu shows the contents of the nested keymap directly, not
as a submenu.

   <p>However, if Emacs is compiled without X toolkit support, or on text
terminals, submenus are not supported.  Each nested keymap is shown as
a menu item, but clicking on it does not automatically pop up the
submenu.  If you wish to imitate the effect of submenus, you can do
that by giving a nested keymap an item string which starts with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This causes Emacs to display the nested keymap using a
separate <dfn>menu pane</dfn>; the rest of the item string after the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; is the pane label.  If Emacs is compiled without X toolkit
support, or if a menu is displayed on a text terminal, menu panes are
not used; in that case, a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning of an item string
is omitted when the menu label is displayed, and has no other effect.
