<h3 class="section">19.6 Completion</h3>

<p><a name="index-completion-1173"></a>
  <dfn>Completion</dfn> is a feature that fills in the rest of a name
starting from an abbreviation for it.  Completion works by comparing the
user's input against a list of valid names and determining how much of
the name is determined uniquely by what the user has typed.  For
example, when you type <kbd>C-x b</kbd> (<code>switch-to-buffer</code>) and then
<!-- "This is the sort of English up with which I will not put." -->
type the first few letters of the name of the buffer to which you wish
to switch, and then type &lt;TAB&gt; (<code>minibuffer-complete</code>), Emacs
extends the name as far as it can.

   <p>Standard Emacs commands offer completion for names of symbols, files,
buffers, and processes; with the functions in this section, you can
implement completion for other kinds of names.

   <p>The <code>try-completion</code> function is the basic primitive for
completion: it returns the longest determined completion of a given
initial string, with a given set of strings to match against.

   <p>The function <code>completing-read</code> provides a higher-level interface
for completion.  A call to <code>completing-read</code> specifies how to
determine the list of valid names.  The function then activates the
minibuffer with a local keymap that binds a few keys to commands useful
for completion.  Other functions provide convenient simple interfaces
for reading certain kinds of names with completion.
