<h3 class="section">11.12 Directory Local Variables</h3>
<a name="index-directory-local-variables"></a>

<p>A directory can specify local variable values common to all files in
that directory; Emacs uses these to create buffer-local bindings for
those variables in buffers visiting any file in that directory.  This
is useful when the files in the directory belong to some <em>project</em>
and therefore share the same local variables.
</p>
<p>There are two different methods for specifying directory local
variables: by putting them in a special file, or by defining a
<em>project class</em> for that directory.

<dt><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Constant/dir%2Dlocals%2Dfile"></a><a name="index-dir_002dlocals_002dfile"></a>Constant: <strong>dir-locals-file</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This constant is the name of the file where Emacs expects to find the
directory-local variables.  The name of the file is
<samp>.dir-locals.el</samp><a name="DOCF8" href="#FOOT8"><sup>8</sup></a>.  A file by that name in a directory causes Emacs to apply its
settings to any file in that directory or any of its subdirectories
(optionally, you can exclude subdirectories; see below).
If some of the subdirectories have their own <samp>.dir-locals.el</samp>
files, Emacs uses the settings from the deepest file it finds starting
from the file’s directory and moving up the directory tree.  The file
specifies local variables as a specially formatted list; see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html#Directory-Variables">Per-directory Local Variables</a> in <cite>The
GNU Emacs Manual</cite>, for more details.

<dd><p>This function reads the <code>.dir-locals.el</code> file and stores the
directory-local variables in <code>file-local-variables-alist</code> that is
local to the buffer visiting any file in the directory, without
applying them.  It also stores the directory-local settings in
<code>dir-locals-class-alist</code>, where it defines a special class for
the directory in which <samp>.dir-locals.el</samp> file was found.  This
function works by calling <code>dir-locals-set-class-variables</code> and
<code>dir-locals-set-directory-class</code>, described below.

<dd><p>This function looks for directory-local variables, and immediately
applies them in the current buffer.  It is intended to be called in
the mode commands for non-file buffers, such as Dired buffers, to let
them obey directory-local variable settings.  For non-file buffers,
Emacs looks for directory-local variables in <code>default-directory</code>
and its parent directories.

<dd><p>This function defines a set of variable settings for the named
<var>class</var>, which is a symbol.  You can later assign the class to one
or more directories, and Emacs will apply those variable settings to
all files in those directories.  The list in <var>variables</var> can be of
one of the two forms: <code>(<var>major-mode</var> . <var>alist</var>)</code> or
<code>(<var>directory</var> . <var>list</var>)</code>.  With the first form, if the
file’s buffer turns on a mode that is derived from <var>major-mode</var>,
then the all the variables in the associated <var>alist</var> are applied;
<var>alist</var> should be of the form <code>(<var>name</var> . <var>value</var>)</code>.
A special value <code>nil</code> for <var>major-mode</var> means the settings are
applicable to any mode.  In <var>alist</var>, you can use a special
<var>name</var>: <code>subdirs</code>.  If the associated value is
<code>nil</code>, the alist is only applied to files in the relevant
directory, not to those in any subdirectories.
</p>
<p>With the second form of <var>variables</var>, if <var>directory</var> is the
initial substring of the file’s directory, then <var>list</var> is applied
recursively by following the above rules; <var>list</var> should be of one
of the two forms accepted by this function in <var>variables</var>.

<dd><p>This function assigns <var>class</var> to all the files in <code>directory</code>
and its subdirectories.  Thereafter, all the variable settings
specified for <var>class</var> will be applied to any visited file in
<var>directory</var> and its children.  <var>class</var> must have been already
defined by <code>dir-locals-set-class-variables</code>.
</p>
<p>Emacs uses this function internally when it loads directory variables
from a <code>.dir-locals.el</code> file.  In that case, the optional
argument <var>mtime</var> holds the file modification time (as returned by
<code>file-attributes</code>).  Emacs uses this time to check stored
local variables are still valid.  If you are assigning a class
directly, not via a file, this argument should be <code>nil</code>.

may be useful for modes that want to ignore directory-locals while
still respecting file-local variables (see <a href="File-Local-Variables.html#File-Local-Variables">File Local Variables</a>).
