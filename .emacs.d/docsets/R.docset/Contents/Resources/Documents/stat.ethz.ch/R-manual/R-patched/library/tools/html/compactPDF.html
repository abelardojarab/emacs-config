<h2>
Compact PDF Files
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Re-save PDF files (especially vignettes) more compactly.
Support function for <code>R CMD build --compact-vignettes</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>compactPDF(paths,
           qpdf = Sys.which(Sys.getenv("R_QPDF", "qpdf")),
           gs_cmd = Sys.getenv("R_GSCMD", ""),
           gs_quality = Sys.getenv("GS_QUALITY", "none"),
           gs_extras = character())

## S3 method for class 'compactPDF'
format(x, ratio = 0.9, diff = 1e4, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td><code>paths</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of paths to PDF files, or a length-one
character vector naming a directory, when all ‘<span class="file">.pdf</span>’ files in
that directory will be used.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>qpdf</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character string giving the path to the <code>qpdf</code>
command.  If empty, <code>qpdf</code> will not be used.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>gs_cmd</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character string giving the path to the GhostScript
executable, if that is to be used.  On Windows this is the path to
‘<span class="file">gswin32c.exe</span>’ or ‘<span class="file">gswin64c.exe</span>’.  If <code>""</code> (the
default), the function will try to find a platform-specific path to
GhostScript where required.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>gs_quality</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string indicating the quality required:
the options are <code>"none"</code> (so GhostScript is not used),
<code>"printer"</code> (300dpi), <code>"ebook"</code> (150dpi) and
<code>"screen"</code> (72dpi).  Can be abbreviated.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>gs_extras</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional character vector of further options to be
passed to GhostScript.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>"compactPDF"</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ratio, diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>Limits for reporting: files are only reported whose
sizes are reduced both by a factor of <code>ratio</code> and by
<code>diff</code> bytes.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Further arguments to be passed to or from other methods.</p>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This by default makes use of <code>qpdf</code>, available from
http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/ (including as a Windows binary) and
included with the CRAN OS X distribution of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.  If <code>gs_cmd</code>
is non-empty and <code>gs_quality != "none"</code>, GhostScript will used
first, then <code>qpdf</code> if it is available.  If <code>gs_quality !=
  "none"</code> and <code>gs_cmd</code> is <code>""</code>, an attempt will be made to find a
GhostScript executable.
</p>
<p><code>qpdf</code> and/or <code>gs_cmd</code> are run on all PDF files found,
and those which are reduced in size by at least 10% and 10Kb are
replaced.
</p>
<p>The strategy of our use of <code>qpdf</code> is to (losslessly) compress
both PDF streams and objects.  GhostScript compresses streams and more
(including downsampling and compressing embedded images) and
consequently is much slower and may lose quality (but can also produce
much smaller PDF files).  However, quality <code>"ebook"</code> is perfectly
adequate for screen viewing and printing on laser printers.
</p>
<p>Where PDF files are changed they will become PDF version 1.5 files:
these have been supported by Acrobat Reader since version 6 in 2003,
so this is very unlikely to cause difficulties.
</p>
<p>Stream compression is what most often has large gains.  Most PDF
documents are generated with object compression, but this does not
seem to be the default for MiKTeX's <code>pdflatex</code>.  For some PDF
files (and especially package vignettes), using GhostScript can
dramatically reduce the space taken by embedded images (often
screenshots).
</p>
<p>Where both GhostScript and <code>qpdf</code> are selected (when
<code>gs_quality != "none"</code> and both executables are found), they are
run in that order and the size reductions apply to the total
compression achieved.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>c("compactPDF", "data.frame")</code>.
This has two columns, the old and new sizes in bytes for the files
that were changed.
</p>
<p>There are <code>format</code> and <code>print</code> methods: the latter passes
<code>...</code> to the format method, so will accept <code>ratio</code> and
<code>diff</code> arguments.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The external tools used may change in future releases.
</p>
<p>Versions of GhostScript 9.06 and later give several times better
compression than 9.05 on some vignettes in CRAN packages.

are available, including Adobe Acrobat (not Reader).
