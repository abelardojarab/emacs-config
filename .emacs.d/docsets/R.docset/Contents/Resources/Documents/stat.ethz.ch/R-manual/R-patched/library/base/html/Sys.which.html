<h2>Find Full Paths to Executables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an interface to the system command <code>which</code>, or to an
emulation on Windows.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
Sys.which(names)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>names</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character vector of names or paths of possible executables.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The system command <code>which</code> reports on the full path names of
an executable (including an executable script) as would be executed by
a shell, accepting either absolute paths or looking on the path.
</p>
<p>On Windows an &lsquo;executable&rsquo; is a file with extension
&lsquo;<span class="file">.exe</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span class="file">.com</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span class="file">.cmd</span>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<span class="file">.bat</span>&rsquo;.  Such files need
not actually be executable, but they are what <code><a href="system.html">system</a></code>
tries.
</p>
<p>On a Unix-alike the full path to <code>which</code> (usually
&lsquo;<span class="file">/usr/bin/which</span>&rsquo;) is found when <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> is installed.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character vector of the same length as <code>names</code>, named by
<code>names</code>.  The elements are either the full path to the
executable  or some indication that no executable of that name was
found.  Typically the indication is <code>""</code>, but this does depend on
the OS (and the known exceptions are changed to <code>""</code>).  Missing
values in <code>names</code> have missing return values (as from <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 3.0.0).
</p>
<p>On Windows the paths will be short paths (8+3 components, no spaces)
with <code>\</code> as the path delimiter.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Except on Windows this calls the system command <code>which</code>: since
that is not part of e.g. the POSIX standards, exactly what it does is
OS-dependent.  It will usually do tilde-expansion and it may make use
of <code>csh</code> aliases.
</p>
<p>In <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 2.x.y, arguments containing spaces or other metacharacters
needed to be escaped as they would be for a shell: for example Windows
paths containing spaces needed to be enclosed in double quotes.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
## the first two are likely to exist everywhere
## texi2dvi exists on most Unix-alikes and under MiKTeX
Sys.which(c("ftp", "ping", "texi2dvi", "this-does-not-exist"))
