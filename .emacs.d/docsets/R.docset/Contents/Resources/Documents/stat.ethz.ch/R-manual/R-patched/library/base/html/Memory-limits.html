<h2>Memory Limits in R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> holds objects it is using in virtual memory.  This help file
documents the current design limitations on large objects: these
differ between 32-bit and 64-bit builds of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Currently <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> runs on 32- and 64-bit operating systems, and most 64-bit
OSes (including Linux, Solaris, Windows and OS X) can run either
32- or 64-bit builds of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.  The memory limits depends mainly on the
build, but for a 32-bit build of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> on Windows they also depend on the
underlying OS version.
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> holds all objects in virtual memory, and there are limits based on the
amount of memory that can be used by all objects:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> There may be limits on the size of the heap and the number of
cons cells allowed – see <code><a href="Memory.html">Memory</a></code> – but these are
usually not imposed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> There is a limit on the (user) address space of a single
process such as the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> executable.  This is system-specific, and can
depend on the executable.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The environment may impose limitations on the resources
available to a single process: Windows' versions of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> do so directly.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Error messages beginning <code>cannot allocate vector of size</code>
indicate a failure to obtain memory, either because the size exceeded
the address-space limit for a process or, more likely, because the
system was unable to provide the memory.  Note that on a 32-bit build
there may well be enough free memory available, but not a large enough
contiguous block of address space into which to map it.
</p>
<p>There are also limits on individual objects. The storage space
cannot exceed the address limit, and if you try to exceed that limit,
the error message begins <code>cannot allocate vector of length</code>.
The number of bytes in a character string is limited to
<i>2^31 - 1 ~ 2*10^9</i>,
which is also the limit on each dimension of an array.
</p>


<h3>Unix</h3>

<p>The address-space limit is system-specific: 32-bit OSes
imposes a limit of no more than 4Gb: it is often 3Gb.  Running
32-bit executables on a 64-bit OS will have similar limits: 64-bit
executables will have an essentially infinite system-specific limit
(e.g., 128Tb for Linux on x86_64 cpus).
</p>
<p>See the OS/shell's help on commands such as <code>limit</code> or
<code>ulimit</code> for how to impose limitations on the resources available
to a single process.  For example a <code>bash</code> user could use
</p>
<pre>ulimit -t 600 -v 4000000
</pre>
<p>whereas a <code>csh</code> user might use
</p>
<pre>limit cputime 10m
limit vmemoryuse 4096m
</pre>
<p>to limit a process to 10 minutes of CPU time and (around) 4Gb of
virtual memory.  (There are other options to set the RAM in use, but they
are not generally honoured.)
</p>


<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>The address-space limit is 2Gb under 32-bit Windows unless the OS's
default has been changed to allow more (up to 3Gb).  See
https://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/server/PAE/PAEmem.mspx
and
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb613473(VS.85).aspx.
Under most 64-bit versions of Windows the limit for a 32-bit build
of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> is 4Gb: for the oldest ones it is 2Gb.  The limit for a 64-bit
build of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> (imposed by the OS) is 8Tb.
</p>
<p>It is not normally possible to allocate as much as 2Gb to a single
vector in a 32-bit build of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> even on 64-bit Windows because of
preallocations by Windows in the middle of the address space.
</p>
<p>Under Windows, <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> imposes limits on the total memory allocation
available to a single session as the OS provides no way to do so: see
<code><a href="../../utils/html/memory.size.html">memory.size</a></code> and <code><a href="../../utils/html/memory.size.html">memory.limit</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code><a href="../../utils/html/object.size.html">object.size</a>(a)</code> for the (approximate) size of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> object
<code>a</code>.
