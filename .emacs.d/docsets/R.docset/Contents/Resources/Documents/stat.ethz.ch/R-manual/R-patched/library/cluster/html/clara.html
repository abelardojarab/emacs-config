<h2>Clustering Large Applications</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes a <code>"clara"</code> object, a list representing a clustering of
the data into <code>k</code> clusters.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
clara(x, k, metric = "euclidean", stand = FALSE, samples = 5,
      sampsize = min(n, 40 + 2 * k), trace = 0, medoids.x = TRUE,
      keep.data = medoids.x, rngR = FALSE, pamLike = FALSE, correct.d = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>data matrix or data frame, each row corresponds to an observation,
and each column corresponds to a variable.  All variables must be numeric.
Missing values (NAs) are allowed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer, the number of clusters.
It is required that <i>0 &lt; k &lt; n</i> where <i>n</i> is the number of
observations (i.e., n = <code>nrow(x)</code>).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>metric</code></td>
<td>

<p>character string specifying the metric to be used for calculating
dissimilarities between observations.
The currently available options are &quot;euclidean&quot; and &quot;manhattan&quot;.
Euclidean distances are root sum-of-squares of differences, and
manhattan distances are the sum of absolute differences.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>stand</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, indicating if the measurements in <code>x</code> are
standardized before calculating the dissimilarities.  Measurements
are standardized for each variable (column), by subtracting the
variable's mean value and dividing by the variable's mean absolute
deviation.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>samples</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer, number of samples to be drawn from the
dataset.  The default, <code>5</code>, is rather small for historical (and
now back compatibility) reasons and we recommend to set
<code>samples</code> an order of magnitude larger.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sampsize</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer, number of observations in each
sample. <code>sampsize</code> should be higher than the number of clusters
(<code>k</code>) and at most the number of observations (n = <code>nrow(x)</code>).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>trace</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer indicating a <em>trace level</em> for diagnostic
output during the algorithm.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>medoids.x</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating if the medoids should be
returned, identically to some rows of the input data <code>x</code>.  If
<code>FALSE</code>, <code>keep.data</code> must be false as well, and the medoid
indices, i.e., row numbers of the medoids will still be returned
(<code>i.med</code> component), and the algorithm saves space by needing
one copy less of <code>x</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>keep.data</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating if the (<em>scaled</em> if
<code>stand</code> is true) data should be kept in the result.


Setting this to <code>FALSE</code> saves memory (and hence time), but
disables <code><a href="clusplot.partition.html">clusplot</a>()</code>ing of the result.  Use
<code>medoids.x = FALSE</code> to save even more memory.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rngR</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating if <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>'s random number generator should
be used instead of the primitive clara()-builtin one.  If true, this
also means that each call to <code>clara()</code> returns a different result
&ndash; though only slightly different in good situations.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pamLike</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating if the &ldquo;swap&rdquo; phase (see
<code><a href="pam.html">pam</a></code>, in C code) should use the same algorithm as
<code><a href="pam.html">pam</a>()</code>.  Note that from Kaufman and Rousseeuw's
description this <em>should</em> have been true always, but as the
original Fortran code and the subsequent port to C has always
contained a small one-letter change (a typo according to Martin Maechler)
with respect to PAM, the default, <code>pamLike = FALSE</code> has been chosen to
remain back compatible rather than &ldquo;PAM compatible&rdquo;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>correct.d</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical or integer indicating that&mdash;only in the case
of <code>NA</code>s present in <code>x</code>&mdash;the correct distance computation
should be used instead of the wrong formula which has been present
in the original Fortran code and been in use up to early 2016.
</p>
<p>Because the new correct formula is not back compatible, for the time
being, a warning is signalled in this case, unless the user explicitly
specifies <code>correct.d</code>.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>clara</code> is fully described in chapter 3 of Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990).
Compared to other partitioning methods such as <code>pam</code>, it can deal with
much larger datasets.  Internally, this is achieved by considering
sub-datasets of fixed size (<code>sampsize</code>) such that the time and
storage requirements become linear in <i>n</i> rather than quadratic.
</p>
<p>Each sub-dataset is partitioned into <code>k</code> clusters using the same
algorithm as in <code><a href="pam.html">pam</a></code>.<br />
Once <code>k</code> representative objects have been selected from the
sub-dataset, each observation of the entire dataset is assigned
to the nearest medoid.
</p>
<p>The mean (equivalent to the sum) of the dissimilarities of the
observations to their closest medoid is used as a measure of the
quality of the clustering.  The sub-dataset for which the mean (or
sum) is minimal, is retained.  A further analysis is carried out on
the final partition.
</p>
<p>Each sub-dataset is forced to contain the medoids obtained from the
best sub-dataset until then.  Randomly drawn observations are added to
this set until <code>sampsize</code> has been reached.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an object of class <code>"clara"</code> representing the clustering.  See
<code><a href="clara.object.html">clara.object</a></code> for details.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>


<p>By default, the random sampling is implemented with a <em>very</em>
simple scheme (with period <i>2^{16} = 65536</i>) inside the Fortran
code, independently of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>'s random number generation, and as a matter
of fact, deterministically.  Alternatively, we recommend setting
<code>rngR = TRUE</code> which uses <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>'s random number generators.  Then,
<code>clara()</code> results are made reproducible typically by using
<code><a href="../../base/html/Random.html">set.seed</a>()</code> before calling <code>clara</code>.
</p>
<p>The storage requirement of <code>clara</code> computation (for small
<code>k</code>) is about
<i>O(n * p) + O(j^2)</i> where
<i>j = \code{sampsize}</i>, and <i>(n,p) = \code{dim(x)}</i>.
The CPU computing time (again assuming small <code>k</code>) is about
<i>O(n * p * j^2 * N)</i>, where
<i>N = \code{samples}</i>.
</p>
<p>For &ldquo;small&rdquo; datasets, the function <code><a href="pam.html">pam</a></code> can be used
directly.  What can be considered <em>small</em>, is really a function
of available computing power, both memory (RAM) and speed.
Originally (1990), &ldquo;small&rdquo; meant less than 100 observations;
in 1997, the authors said <em>&ldquo;small (say with fewer than 200
observations)&rdquo;</em>; as of 2006, you can use <code><a href="pam.html">pam</a></code> with
several thousand observations.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
## generate 500 objects, divided into 2 clusters.
x &lt;- rbind(cbind(rnorm(200,0,8), rnorm(200,0,8)),
           cbind(rnorm(300,50,8), rnorm(300,50,8)))
clarax &lt;- clara(x, 2, samples=50)
clarax
clarax$clusinfo
## using pamLike=TRUE  gives the same (apart from the 'call'):
all.equal(clarax[-8],
          clara(x, 2, samples=50, pamLike = TRUE)[-8])
plot(clarax)

## `xclara' is an artificial data set with 3 clusters of 1000 bivariate
## objects each.
data(xclara)
(clx3 &lt;- clara(xclara, 3))
## "better" number of samples
cl.3 &lt;- clara(xclara, 3, samples=100)
## but that did not change the result here:
stopifnot(cl.3$clustering == clx3$clustering)
## Plot similar to Figure 5 in Struyf et al (1996)
## Not run: plot(clx3, ask = TRUE)


## Try 100 times *different* random samples -- for reliability:
nSim &lt;- 100
nCl &lt;- 3 # = no.classes
set.seed(421)# (reproducibility)
cl &lt;- matrix(NA,nrow(xclara), nSim)
for(i in 1:nSim)
   cl[,i] &lt;- clara(xclara, nCl, medoids.x = FALSE, rngR = TRUE)$cluster
tcl &lt;- apply(cl,1, tabulate, nbins = nCl)
## those that are not always in same cluster (5 out of 3000 for this seed):
(iDoubt &lt;- which(apply(tcl,2, function(n) all(n &lt; nSim))))
if(length(iDoubt)) { # (not for all seeds)
  tabD &lt;- tcl[,iDoubt, drop=FALSE]
  dimnames(tabD) &lt;- list(cluster = paste(1:nCl), obs = format(iDoubt))
  t(tabD) # how many times in which clusters
}
