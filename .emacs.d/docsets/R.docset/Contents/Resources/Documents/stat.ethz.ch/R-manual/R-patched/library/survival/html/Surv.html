<h2>
Create a Survival Object 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a survival object, usually used as a response variable in a model 
formula. Argument matching is special for this function, see Details below.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
Surv(time, time2, event,
    type=c('right', 'left', 'interval', 'counting', 'interval2', 'mstate'),
    origin=0)
is.Surv(x)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>time</code></td>
<td>

<p>for right censored data, this is the follow up time.  For interval
data, the first argument is the starting time for the interval. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>event</code></td>
<td>

<p>The status indicator, normally 0=alive, 1=dead.  Other choices are
<code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> (<code>TRUE</code> = death) or 1/2 (2=death). For
interval censored data, the status indicator is 0=right censored,
1=event at <code>time</code>, 2=left censored, 3=interval censored.
Although unusual, the event indicator can be omitted, in which case
all subjects are assumed to have an event.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>time2</code></td>
<td>

<p>ending time of the interval for interval censored  or counting
process data only.  Intervals are assumed to be open on the left and
closed on the right, <code>(start, end]</code>.  For counting process
data, <code>event</code> indicates whether an event occurred at the end of
the interval.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>

<p>character string specifying the type of censoring. Possible values
are <code>"right"</code>, <code>"left"</code>, <code>"counting"</code>,
<code>"interval"</code>, <code>"interval2"</code> or <code>"mstate"</code>.  
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>origin</code></td>
<td>

<p>for counting process data, the hazard function origin.  This option
was intended to be used in conjunction with a model containing
time dependent
strata in order to align the subjects properly when they cross over
from one strata to another, but it has rarely proven useful.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>any R object.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When the <code>type</code> argument is missing the code assumes a type based
on the following rules:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> If there are two unnamed arguments, they will match <code>time</code> and
<code>event</code> in that order.  If there are three unnamed arguments
they match <code>time</code>, <code>time2</code> and <code>event</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If the event variable is a factor then type <code>mstate</code> is
assumed.  Otherwise type <code>right</code> if there is no <code>time2</code>
argumement, and type <code>counting</code> if there is.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>As a consequence the <code>type</code> argument can usually be omitted.
</p>
<p>When the survival type is &quot;mstate&quot; then the status variable will be
treated as a factor.  The first level of the factor is taken to
represent censoring and remaining ones a transition to the given state.
</p>
<p>Interval censored data can be represented in two ways.  For the first
use <code>type = "interval"</code> and the codes shown above.  In that usage the
value of the <code>time2</code> argument is ignored unless event=3.
The second approach is to think of each observation as a time
interval with (-infinity, t) for left censored, (t, infinity) for
right censored, (t,t) for exact and (t1, t2) for an interval.
This is the approach used for type = interval2.  Infinite values can
be represented either by actual infinity (Inf) or NA.
The second form has proven to be the more useful one.
</p>
<p>Presently, the only methods allowing interval censored data are the 
parametric models computed by <code>survreg</code> and survival curves
computed by <code>survfit</code>; for both of these, 
the distinction between open and closed intervals
is unimportant.  
The distinction is important for counting process data and 
the Cox model. 
</p>
<p>The function tries to distinguish between the use of 0/1 and 1/2 coding for 
censored data via the condition 
<code>if (max(status)==2)</code>. 
If 1/2 coding is used and all the subjects are censored, it will 
guess wrong.
In any questionable case it is safer to use logical coding,
e.g., <code>Surv(time, status==3)</code> would indicate that a <code>3</code> is
the code for an event.
</p>
<p>For multi-state survival (type= &quot;mstate&quot;) the status variable can have
multiple levels.  The first of these will stand for censoring, and the
others for various event types, e.g., causes of death.  
</p>
<p>Surv objects can be subscripted either as a vector, e.g.
<code>x[1:3]</code> using a single subscript,
in which case the <code>drop</code> argument is ignored and the result will be
a survival object; 
or as a matrix by using two subscripts.
If the second subscript is missing and <code>drop=F</code>
(the default),
the result of the subscripting will be a Surv object, e.g., 
<code>x[1:3,,drop=F]</code>,
otherwise the result will be a matrix (or vector), in accordance with
the default behavior for subscripting matrices. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>Surv</code>.  There are methods for <code>print</code>,
<code>is.na</code>, and subscripting survival objects.   <code>Surv</code> objects
are implemented as a matrix of 2 or 3 columns that has further
attributes. These include the type (left censored, right censored,
counting process, etc.) and labels for the states for multi-state
objects.  Any attributes of the input arguments are also preserved
in <code>inputAttributes</code>.  This may be useful for other packages that
have attached further information to data items such as labels; none
of the routines in the survival package make use of these
values, however.
</p>
<p>In the case of <code>is.Surv</code>, a logical value <code>TRUE</code> if <code>x</code>
inherits from class <code>"Surv"</code>, otherwise an <code>FALSE</code>.
