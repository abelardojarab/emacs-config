<h2>
Set Actions For Package Loading
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions provide a mechanism for packages to specify
computations to be done during the loading of a package namespace.
Such actions are a flexible way to provide information only available at
load time (such as locations in a dynamically linked library).
</p>
<p>A call to <code>setLoadAction()</code> or <code>setLoadActions()</code> specifies
one or more functions to be called when the corresponding namespace is
loaded, with the ... argument names being used as identifying
names for the actions.
</p>
<p><code>getLoadActions</code> reports the currently defined load actions,
given a package's namespace as its argument.
</p>
<p><code>hasLoadAction</code> returns <code>TRUE</code> if a load action
corresponding to the given name has previously been set for the
<code>where</code> namespace.
</p>
<p><code>evalOnLoad()</code> and <code>evalqOnLoad()</code> schedule a specific
expression for evaluation at load time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
setLoadAction(action, aname=, where=)

setLoadActions(..., .where=)

getLoadActions(where=)

hasLoadAction(aname, where=)

evalOnLoad(expr, where=, aname=)

evalqOnLoad(expr, where=, aname=)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>action, ...</code></td>
<td>

<p>functions of one or more arguments, to be called when this package is
loaded. The functions will be called with one argument (the package
namespace) so all following arguments must have default values.
</p>
<p>If the elements of ... are named, these names will be used for the
corresponding load metadata.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>where, .where</code></td>
<td>

<p>the namespace of the package for which the list of load actions are
defined. This argument is normally omitted if the call comes from the
source code for the package itself, but will be needed if a package
supplies load actions for another package.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>aname</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name for the action.  If an action is set without
supplying a name,  the default uses the position in the sequence of
actions specified (<code>".1"</code>, etc.).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>expr</code></td>
<td>
<p>an expression to be evaluated in a load action in
environment <code>where</code>.  In the case of <code>evalqOnLoad()</code>,
the expression is interpreted literally, in that of
<code>evalOnLoad()</code> it must be precomputed, typically as an object
of type <code>"language"</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>evalOnLoad()</code> and <code>evalqOnLoad()</code> functions are for
convenience.  They construct a function to evaluate the expression and
call <code>setLoadAction()</code> to schedule a call to that function.
</p>
<p>Each of the functions supplied as an argument to <code>setLoadAction()</code>
or <code>setLoadActions()</code> is saved as metadata in the namespace,
typically that of the package containing the call to
<code>setLoadActions()</code>.  When this package's namespace is loaded, each
of these functions will be called.  Action functions are called in the
order they are supplied to <code>setLoadActions()</code>.  The objects
assigned have metadata names constructed from the names supplied in the
call; unnamed arguments are taken to be named by their position in the
list of actions (<code>".1"</code>, etc.).
</p>
<p>Multiple calls to <code>setLoadAction()</code> or <code>setLoadActions()</code>
can be used in a package's code; the actions will be scheduled after any
previously specified, except if the name given to <code>setLoadAction()</code>
is that of an existing action.  In typical applications,
<code>setLoadActions()</code> is more convenient when calling from the
package's own code to set several actions.  Calls to
<code>setLoadAction()</code> are more convenient if the action name is to be
constructed, which is more typical when one package constructs load
actions for another package.
</p>
<p>Actions can be revised by assigning with the same name, actual or
constructed, in a subsequent call.  The replacement must still be a
valid function, but can of course do nothing if the intention was to
remove a previously specified action.
</p>
<p>The functions must have at least one argument.  They will be called with
one argument, the namespace of the package.  The functions will be
called at the end of processing of S4 metadata, after dynamically
linking any compiled code, the call to <code>.onLoad()</code>, if any, and
caching method and class definitions, but before the namespace is
sealed.  (Load actions are only called if methods dispatch is on.)
</p>
<p>Functions may therefore assign or modify objects in the namespace
supplied as the argument in the call.  The mechanism allows packages
to save information not available until load time, such as values
obtained from a dynamically linked library.
</p>
<p>Load actions should be contrasted with user load hooks supplied by
<code><a href="../../base/html/userhooks.html">setHook</a>()</code>.  User hooks are generally provided from
outside the package and are run after the namespace has been sealed.
Load actions are normally part of the package code, and the list of
actions is normally established when the package is installed.
</p>
<p>Load actions can be supplied directly in the source code for a
package.  It is also possible and useful to provide facilities in one
package to create load actions in another package.  The software needs
to be careful to assign the action functions in the correct
environment, namely the namespace of the target package.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

  
<p><code>setLoadAction()</code> and <code>setLoadActions()</code> are called for
their side effect and return no useful value.
</p>
<p><code>getLoadActions()</code> returns a named list of the actions in the
supplied namespace.
</p>
<p><code>hasLoadAction()</code> returns <code>TRUE</code> if the specified action
name appears in the actions for this package.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code><a href="../../base/html/userhooks.html">setHook</a></code> for safer (since they are run after the
namespace is sealed) and more comprehensive versions in the
base package.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
## Not run: 
## in the code for some package

## ... somewhere else
setLoadActions(function(ns)
   cat("Loaded package", sQuote(getNamespaceName(ns)),
       "at", format(Sys.time()), "\n"),
  setCount = function(ns) assign("myCount", 1, envir = ns),
  function(ns) assign("myPointer", getMyExternalPointer(), envir = ns))
  ... somewhere later
if(countShouldBe0)
  setLoadAction(function(ns) assign("myCount", 0, envir = ns), "setCount")

## End(Not run)
