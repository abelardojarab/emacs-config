<h2>Read Octave Text Data Files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Read a file in Octave text data format into a list.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>read.octave(file)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string with the name of the file to read.</p>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is used to read in files in Octave text data format, as
created by <code>save -text</code> in Octave.  It knows about most of the
common types of variables, including the standard atomic (real and
complex scalars, matrices, and <i>N</i>-d arrays, strings, ranges, and
boolean scalars and matrices) and recursive (structs, cells, and
lists) ones, but has no guarantee to read all types.  If a type is not
recognized, a warning indicating the unknown type is issued, it is
attempted to skip the unknown entry, and <code>NULL</code> is used as its
value.  Note that this will give incorrect results, and maybe even
errors, in the case of unknown recursive data types.
</p>
<p>As Octave can read MATLAB binary files, one can make the contents of
such files available to R by using Octave's load and save (as text)
facilities as an intermediary step.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with one named component for each variable in the file.
</p>
