<h2>Wildcard Expansion on File Paths</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to do wildcard expansion (also known as ‘globbing’) on
file paths.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>Sys.glob(paths, dirmark = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td><code>paths</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of patterns for relative or absolute
filepaths.  Missing values will be ignored.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dirmark</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: should matches to directories from patterns
that do not already end in <code>/</code>
have a slash appended?  May not be supported on all platforms.</p>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This expands wildcards in file paths.  For precise details, see your
system's documentation on the <code>glob</code> system call.  There is a
POSIX 1003.2 standard (see
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/glob.html)
but some OSes will go beyond this.  The <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> implementation will always
do <a href="path.expand.html">tilde expansion</a>.
</p>
<p>All systems should interpret <code>*</code> (match zero or more characters),
<code>?</code> (match a single character) and (probably) <code>[</code> (begin a
character class or range).  The handling of paths
ending with a separator is system-dependent.  On a POSIX-2008
compliant OS they will match directories (only), but as they are not
valid filepaths on Windows, they match nothing there.  (Earlier POSIX
standards allowed them to match files.)

</p>
<p>The rest of these details are indicative (and based on the POSIX
standard).
</p>
<p>If a filename starts with <code>.</code> this may need to be matched
explicitly: for example <code>Sys.glob("*.RData")</code> may or may not
match ‘<span class="file">.RData</span>’ but will not usually match ‘<span class="file">.aa.RData</span>’.  Note
that this is platform-dependent: e.g. on Solaris
<code>Sys.glob("*.*")</code> matches ‘<span class="file">.</span>’ and ‘<span class="file">..</span>’.
</p>
<p><code>[</code> begins a character class.  If the first character in
<code>[...]</code> is not <code>!</code>, this is a character class which matches
a single character against any of the characters specified.  The class
cannot be empty, so <code>]</code> can be included provided it is first.  If
the first character is <code>!</code>, the character class matches a single
character which is <em>none</em> of the specified characters.  Whether
<code>.</code> in a character class matches a leading <code>.</code> in the
filename is OS-dependent.
</p>
<p>Character classes can include ranges such as <code>[A-Z]</code>: include
<code>-</code> as a character by having it first or last in a class.  (The
interpretation of ranges should be locale-specific, so the example is
not a good idea in an Estonian locale.)
</p>
<p>One can remove the special meaning of <code>?</code>, <code>*</code>  and
<code>[</code> by preceding them by a backslash (except within a
character class).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character vector of matched file paths.  The order is
system-specific (but in the order of the elements of <code>paths</code>): it
is normally collated in either the current locale or in byte (ASCII)
order; however, on Windows collation is in the order of Unicode
points.
</p>
<p>Directory errors are normally ignored, so the matches are to
accessible file paths (but not necessarily accessible files).
