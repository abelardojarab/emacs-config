<h2> Create and Save a Method </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create and save a formal method for a given function and list of classes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
setMethod(f, signature=character(), definition,
          where = topenv(parent.frame()),
          valueClass = NULL, sealed = FALSE)

removeMethod(f, signature, where)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>f</code></td>
<td>
<p> A generic function or the character-string name of the function. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>signature</code></td>
<td>
<p> A match of formal argument names for <code>f</code> with
the character-string names of corresponding classes.  See the
details below; however, if the signature is not trivial, you should use <code><a href="method.skeleton.html">method.skeleton</a></code> to generate a valid call to <code>setMethod</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>definition</code></td>
<td>
<p> A function definition, which will become the method
called when the arguments in a call to <code>f</code> match the
classes in <code>signature</code>, directly or through inheritance. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>where</code></td>
<td>
<p>the environment in which to store the definition of the
method.
For <code>setMethod</code>, it is recommended to omit this argument and to include the call in source code that is evaluated at the top level; that is, either in an R session by something equivalent to a call to <code><a href="../../base/html/source.html">source</a></code>, or as part of the R source code for a package.
</p>
<p>For <code>removeMethod</code>, the default is the location of the (first)
instance of the method for this signature.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>valueClass</code></td>
<td>
<p> Obsolete and unused, but see the same argument for <code><a href="setGeneric.html">setGeneric</a></code>. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sealed</code></td>
<td>
<p> If <code>TRUE</code>, the method so defined cannot be
redefined by another call to <code>setMethod</code> (although it can
be removed and then re-assigned).</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The call to <code>setMethod</code> stores the supplied method definition  in
the metadata table for this generic function in the environment,
typically the global environment or the namespace of a package.
In the case of a package, the table object becomes part of the namespace or environment of the
package.
When the package is loaded into a later session, the
methods will be merged into the table of methods in the corresponding
generic function object.
</p>
<p>Generic functions are referenced by the combination of the function name and
the package name;
for example, the function <code>"show"</code> from the package
<code>"methods"</code>.
Metadata for methods is identified by the two strings; in particular, the
generic function object itself has slots containing its name and its
package name.
The package name of a generic is set according to the package
from which it originally comes; in particular, and frequently, the
package where a non-generic version of the function originated.
For example, generic functions for all the functions in package <span class="pkg">base</span> will
have <code>"base"</code> as the package name, although none of them is an
S4 generic on that package.
These include most of the base functions that are primitives, rather than
true functions; see the section on primitive functions in the
documentation for <code><a href="setGeneric.html">setGeneric</a></code> for details.
</p>
<p>Multiple packages can have methods for the same generic function; that
is, for the same combination of generic function name and package
name.
Even though the methods are stored in separate tables in separate
environments, loading the corresponding packages adds the methods to
the table in the generic function itself, for the duration of the session.
</p>
<p>The class
names in the signature can be any formal class, including basic
classes such as <code>"numeric"</code>, <code>"character"</code>, and
<code>"matrix"</code>.  Two additional special class names can appear:
<code>"ANY"</code>, meaning that this argument can have any class at all;
and <code>"missing"</code>, meaning that this argument <em>must not</em>
appear in the call in order to match this signature.  Don't confuse
these two:  if an argument isn't mentioned in a signature, it
corresponds implicitly to class <code>"ANY"</code>, not to
<code>"missing"</code>.  See the example below.  Old-style (&lsquo;S3&rsquo;)
classes can also be used, if you need compatibility with these, but
you should definitely declare these classes by calling
<code><a href="setOldClass.html">setOldClass</a></code> if you want S3-style inheritance to work.
</p>
<p>Method definitions can
have default expressions for arguments, but a current limitation is
that the generic function must have <em>some</em> default expression for the
same argument in order for the method's defaults to be used.
If so, and if the corresponding argument is
missing in the call to the generic function, the default expression
in the method is used.  If the method definition has no default for
the argument, then the expression supplied in the definition of the
generic function itself is used, but note that this expression will
be evaluated using the enclosing environment of the method, not of
the generic function.
Note also that specifying class <code>"missing"</code> in the signature
does not require any default expressions, and method selection does
not evaluate default expressions.
All actual (non-missing) arguments in the signature of the
generic function will be evaluated when a method is selected&mdash;when
the call to <code>standardGeneric(f)</code> occurs.
</p>
<p>It is possible to have some differences between the
formal arguments to a method supplied to <code>setMethod</code> and those
of the generic. Roughly, if the generic has ... as one of its
arguments, then the method may have extra formal arguments, which
will be matched from the arguments matching ... in the call to
<code>f</code>.  (What actually happens is that a local function is
created inside the method, with the modified formal arguments, and the method
is re-defined to call that local function.)
</p>
<p>Method dispatch tries to match the class of the actual arguments in a
call to the available methods collected for <code>f</code>.  If there is a
method defined for the exact same classes as in this call, that
method is used.  Otherwise, all possible signatures are considered
corresponding to the actual classes or to superclasses of the actual
classes (including <code>"ANY"</code>).
The method having the least distance from the actual classes is
chosen; if more than one method has minimal distance, one is chosen
(the lexicographically first in terms of superclasses) but a warning
is issued.
All inherited methods chosen are stored in another table, so that
the inheritance calculations only need to be done once per session
per sequence of actual classes.
See
<a href="Methods.html">Methods</a> for more details.
</p>
<p>The function <code>removeMethod</code> removes the specified method from the
metadata table in the corresponding environment.
It's not a function that is used much, since one normally wants to
redefine a method rather than leave no definition.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>These functions exist for their side-effect, in setting or removing a
method in the object defining methods for the specified generic.
</p>
<p>The value returned by <code>removeMethod</code> is <code>TRUE</code> if a method
was found to be removed.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>


require(graphics)
## methods for plotting track objects (see the example for \link{setClass})
##
## First, with only one object as argument:
setMethod("plot", signature(x="track", y="missing"),
  function(x,  y, ...) plot(slot(x, "x"), slot(x, "y"), ...)
)
## Second, plot the data from the track on the y-axis against anything
## as the x data.
setMethod("plot", signature(y = "track"),
 function(x, y, ...) plot(x, slot(y, "y"), ...)
)
## and similarly with the track on the x-axis (using the short form of
## specification for signatures)
setMethod("plot", "track",
 function(x, y, ...) plot(slot(x, "y"), y,  ...)
)
t1 &lt;- new("track", x=1:20, y=(1:20)^2)
tc1 &lt;- new("trackCurve", t1)
slot(tc1, "smooth") &lt;- smooth.spline(slot(tc1, "x"), slot(tc1, "y"))$y #$
plot(t1)
plot(qnorm(ppoints(20)), t1)
## An example of inherited methods, and of conforming method arguments
## (note the dotCurve argument in the method, which will be pulled out
## of ... in the generic.
setMethod("plot", c("trackCurve", "missing"),
function(x, y, dotCurve = FALSE, ...) {
  plot(as(x, "track"))
  if(length(slot(x, "smooth") &gt; 0))
    lines(slot(x, "x"), slot(x, "smooth"),
         lty = if(dotCurve) 2 else 1)
  }
)
## the plot of tc1 alone has an added curve; other uses of tc1
## are treated as if it were a "track" object.
plot(tc1, dotCurve = TRUE)
plot(qnorm(ppoints(20)), tc1)

## defining methods for a special function.
## Although "[" and "length" are not ordinary functions
## methods can be defined for them.
setMethod("[", "track",
  function(x, i, j, ..., drop) {
    x@x &lt;- x@x[i]; x@y &lt;- x@y[i]
    x
  })
plot(t1[1:15])

setMethod("length", "track", function(x)length(x@y))
length(t1)

## methods can be defined for missing arguments as well
setGeneric("summary") ## make the function into a generic

## A method for summary()
## The method definition can include the arguments, but
## if they're omitted, class "missing" is assumed.

setMethod("summary", "missing", function() "&lt;No Object&gt;")
