<h2>Reporting mgcv bugs.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>mgcv</code> works largely because many people have reported bugs over the years. If you find something that looks like a bug, please report it, so that the package can be improved. <code>mgcv</code> does not have a large development budget, so it is a big help if bug reports follow the following guidlines.
</p>
<p>The ideal report consists of an email to simon.wood@r-project.org with a subject line including <code>mgcv</code> somewhere, containing
</p>

<ol>
<li><p> The results of running <code><a href="../../utils/html/sessionInfo.html">sessionInfo</a></code> in the R session where the problem occurs. This provides platform details, R and package version numbers, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A brief description of the problem.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Short cut and paste-able code that produces the problem, including the code for loading/generating the data (using standard R functions like <code>load</code>, <code>read.table</code> etc).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Any required data files. If you send real data it will only be used for the purposes of de-bugging.
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Of course if you have dug deeper and have an idea of what is causing the problem, that is also helpful to know, as is any suggested code fix. (Don't send a fixed package .tar.gz file, however - I can't use this).   
</p>
