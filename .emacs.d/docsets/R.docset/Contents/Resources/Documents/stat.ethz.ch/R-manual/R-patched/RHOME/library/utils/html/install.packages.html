<p>Download and install packages from CRAN-like repositories or from
local files.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
install.packages(pkgs, lib, repos = getOption("repos"),
                 contriburl = contrib.url(repos, type),
                 method, available = NULL, destdir = NULL,
                 dependencies = NA, type = getOption("pkgType"),
                 configure.args = getOption("configure.args"),
                 configure.vars = getOption("configure.vars"),
                 clean = FALSE, Ncpus = getOption("Ncpus", 1L),
                 verbose = getOption("verbose"),
                 libs_only = FALSE, INSTALL_opts, quiet = FALSE,
                 keep_outputs = FALSE, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pkgs</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of the names of packages whose
current versions should be downloaded from the repositories.
</p>
<p>If <code>repos = NULL</code>, a character vector of
file paths.  These can be source directories or archives
or binary package archive files (as created by <code>R CMD build
      --binary</code>).  (<code>http://</code> and <code>file://</code> URLs are also
accepted and the files will be downloaded and installed from local
copies.)  On a CRAN build of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> for OS X these can be &lsquo;<span class="file">.tgz</span>&rsquo;
files containing binary package archives.
Tilde-expansion will be done on file paths.
</p>
<p>If this is missing or a zero-length character vector, a listbox of
available packages is presented where possible in an interactive <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>
session.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>lib</code></td>
<td>

<p>character vector giving the library directories where to
install the packages.  Recycled as needed.  If missing, defaults to
the first element of <code><a href="../../base/html/libPaths.html">.libPaths</a>()</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>repos</code></td>
<td>

<p>character vector, the base URL(s) of the repositories
to use, e.g., the URL of a CRAN mirror such as
<code>"http://cran.us.r-project.org"</code>.  For more details on
supported URL schemes see <code><a href="../../base/html/connections.html">url</a></code>.
</p>
<p>Can be <code>NULL</code> to install from local files, directories or URLs:
this will be inferred by extension from <code>pkgs</code> if of length one.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>contriburl</code></td>
<td>

<p>URL(s) of the contrib sections of the repositories.  Use this
argument if your repository mirror is incomplete, e.g., because
you burned only the &lsquo;<span class="file">contrib</span>&rsquo; section on a CD, or only have
binary packages.  Overrides argument <code>repos</code>.
Incompatible with <code>type = "both"</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>method</code></td>
<td>

<p>download method, see <code><a href="download.file.html">download.file</a></code>.  Unused if
a non-<code>NULL</code> <code>available</code> is supplied.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>available</code></td>
<td>

<p>a matrix as returned by <code><a href="available.packages.html">available.packages</a></code>
listing packages available at the repositories, or <code>NULL</code> when
the function makes an internal call to <code>available.packages</code>.
Incompatible with <code>type = "both"</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>destdir</code></td>
<td>

<p>directory where downloaded packages are stored.  If it is
<code>NULL</code> (the default) a subdirectory
<code>downloaded_packages</code> of the session temporary
directory will be used (and the files will be deleted
at the end of the session).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dependencies</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating whether to also install
uninstalled packages which these packages depend on/link
to/import/suggest (and so on recursively).  Not used if <code>repos
    = NULL</code>.  Can also be a character vector, a subset of
<code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests", "Enhances")</code>.
</p>
<p>Only supported if <code>lib</code> is of length one (or missing),
so it is unambiguous where to install the dependent packages.  If
this is not the case it is ignored, with a warning.
</p>
<p>The default, <code>NA</code>, means
<code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")</code>.
</p>
<p><code>TRUE</code> means to use
<code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests")</code> for
<code>pkgs</code> and
<code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")</code> for added dependencies:
this installs all the packages needed to run <code>pkgs</code>, their
examples, tests and vignettes (if the package author specified them
correctly).
</p>
<p>In all of these, <code>"LinkingTo"</code> is omitted for binary packages.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>character, indicating the type of package to download and
install.  Will be <code>"source"</code> except on Windows and some OS X
builds: see the section on &lsquo;Binary packages&rsquo; for those.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>configure.args</code></td>
<td>

<p>(Used only for source installs.) A character vector or a named list.
If a character vector with no names is supplied, the elements are
concatenated into a single string (separated by a space) and used as
the value for the <span class="option">--configure-args</span> flag in the call to
<code>R CMD INSTALL</code>.  If the character vector has names these
are assumed to identify values for <span class="option">--configure-args</span> for
individual packages.  This allows one to specify settings for an
entire collection of packages which will be used if any of those
packages are to be installed.  (These settings can therefore be
re-used and act as default settings.)
</p>
<p>A named list can be used also to the same effect, and that
allows multi-element character strings for each package
which are concatenated to a single string to be used as the
value for <span class="option">--configure-args</span>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>configure.vars</code></td>
<td>

<p>(Used only for source installs.) Analogous to <code>configure.args</code>
for flag <span class="option">--configure-vars</span>, which is used to set environment
variables for the <code>configure</code> run.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>clean</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value indicating whether to add the
<span class="option">--clean</span> flag to the call to <code>R CMD INSTALL</code>.
This is sometimes used to perform additional operations at the end
of the package installation in addition to removing intermediate files.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Ncpus</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of parallel processes to use for a parallel
install of more than one source package.  Values greater than one
are supported if the <code>make</code> command specified by
<code>Sys.getenv("MAKE", "make")</code> accepts argument <code>-k -j
    <var>Ncpus</var></code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>

<p>a logical indicating if some &ldquo;progress report&rdquo; should be given.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>libs_only</code></td>
<td>

<p>a logical value: should the <span class="option">--libs-only</span> option be used to
install only additional sub-architectures for source installs?  (See also
<code>INSTALL_opts</code>.)  This can also be used on Windows to install
just the DLL(s) from a binary package, e.g. to add 64-bit
DLLs to a 32-bit install.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>INSTALL_opts</code></td>
<td>

<p>an optional character vector of additional option(s) to be passed to
<code>R CMD INSTALL</code> for a source package install.  E.g.,
<code>c("--html", "--no-multiarch")</code>.
</p>
<p>Can also be a named list of character vectors to be used as
additional options, with names the respective package names.
</p>

<p>logical: if true, reduce the amount of output.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>keep_outputs</code></td>

in the current working directory, with the names of the output files
the package names with &lsquo;<span class="file">.out</span>&rsquo; appended.  Alternatively, a
character string giving the directory in which to save the outputs.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is the main function to install packages.  It takes a vector of
names and a destination library, downloads the packages from the
repositories and installs them.  (If the library is omitted it
defaults to the first directory in <code>.libPaths()</code>, with a message
if there is more than one.)  If <code>lib</code> is omitted or is of length
one and is not a (group) writable directory, in interactive use the
code offers to create a personal library tree (the first element of
<code>Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")</code>) and install there.
</p>
<p>For installs from a repository an attempt is made to install the
packages in an order that respects their dependencies.  This does
assume that all the entries in <code>lib</code> are on the default library
path for installs (set by environment variable <span class="env">R_LIBS</span>).
</p>
<p>You are advised to run <code>update.packages</code> before
<code>install.packages</code> to ensure that any already installed
dependencies have their latest versions.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisible <code>NULL</code>.
</p>


<h3>Binary packages</h3>

<p>This section applies only to platforms where binary packages are
available: Windows and CRAN builds for OS X.
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> packages are primarily distributed as <em>source</em> packages, but
<em>binary</em> packages (a packaging up of the installed package) are
also supported, and the type most commonly used on Windows and by the
CRAN builds for OS X.  This function can install either type, either by
downloading a file from a repository or from a local file.
</p>
<p>Possible values of <code>type</code> are (currently) <code>"source"</code>,
<code>"mac.binary"</code>, <code>"mac.binary.mavericks"</code> and
<code>"win.binary"</code>: the appropriate binary type where
supported can also be selected as <code>"binary"</code>.
</p>
<p>For a binary install from a repository, the function checks for the
availability of a source package on the same repository, and reports
if the source package has a later version, or is available but no
binary version is.  This check can be suppressed by using
</p>
<pre>    options(install.packages.check.source = "no")</pre>
<p>and should be if there is a partial repository containing only binary
files.
</p>
<p>An alternative (and the current default) is <code>"both"</code> which means
&lsquo;use binary if available and current, otherwise try
source&rsquo;. The action if there are source packages which are preferred
but may contain code which needs to be compiled is controlled by
<code><a href="../../base/html/options.html">getOption</a>("install.packages.compile.from.source")</code>.
<code>type = "both"</code> will be silently changed to <code>"binary"</code> if
either <code>contriburl</code> or <code>available</code> is specified.
</p>
<p>Using packages with <code>type = "source"</code> always works provided the
package contains no C/C++/Fortran code that needs compilation.
Otherwise, on OS X you otherwise need to have installed the
&lsquo;Command-line tools for Xcode&rsquo; (see the &lsquo;R Installation
and Administration Manual&rsquo;) and if needed by the package a Fortran
compiler, and have them in your path.
</p>


<h3>Locking</h3>

<p>There are various options for locking: these differ between source and
binary installs.
</p>
<p>By default for a source install, the library directory is
&lsquo;locked&rsquo; by creating a directory &lsquo;<span class="file">00LOCK</span>&rsquo; within it.  This
has two purposes: it prevents any other process installing into that
library concurrently, and is used to store any previous version of the
package to restore on error.  A finer-grained locking is provided by
the option <span class="option">--pkglock</span> which creates a separate lock for each
package: this allows enough freedom for parallel
installation.  Per-package locking is the default when installing a
single package, and for multiple packages when <code>Ncpus &gt; 1L</code>.
Finally locking (and restoration on error) can be suppressed by
<span class="option">--no-lock</span>.

</p>
<p>For an OS X or Windows binary install, no locking is done by
default.  Setting argument <code>lock</code> to <code>TRUE</code> (it defaults to
the value of <code><a href="../../base/html/options.html">getOption</a>("install.lock", FALSE)</code>) will use
per-directory locking as described for source installs: if the value
is <code>"pkglock"</code> per-package locking will be used.
</p>
<p>If package locking is used on Windows with <code>libs_only = TRUE</code> and
the installation fails, the package will be restored to its previous
state.
</p>
<p>Note that it is possible for the package installation to fail so badly
that the lock directory is not removed: this inhibits any further
installs to the library directory (or for <code>--pkglock</code>, of the
package) until the lock directory is removed manually.
</p>


<h3>Parallel installs</h3>

<p>Parallel installs are attempted if <code>pkgs</code> has length greater than
one and <code>Ncpus &gt; 1</code>.  It makes use of a parallel <code>make</code>,
so the <code>make</code> specified (default <code>make</code>) when <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> was
built must be capable of supporting <code>make -j <var>n</var></code>: GNU make,
<code>dmake</code> and <code>pmake</code> do, but Solaris <code>make</code> and
older FreeBSD <code>make</code> do not: if necessary environment variable
<span class="env">MAKE</span> can be set for the current session to select a suitable
<code>make</code>.
</p>
<p><code>install.packages</code> needs to be able to compute all the
dependencies of <code>pkgs</code> from <code>available</code>, including if one
element of <code>pkgs</code> depends indirectly on another.  This means that
if for example you are installing <acronym><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></acronym> packages which depend
on Bioconductor packages which in turn depend on <acronym><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></acronym>
packages, <code>available</code> needs to cover both <acronym><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></acronym> and
Bioconductor packages.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Some binary distributions of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> have <code>INSTALL</code> in a separate
bundle, e.g. an <code>R-devel</code> RPM.  <code>install.packages</code> will
give an error if called with <code>type = "source"</code> on such a system.
</p>
<p>Some binary Linux distributions of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> can be installed on a machine
without the tools needed to install packages: a possible remedy is to
do a complete install of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> which should bring in all those tools as
dependencies.
