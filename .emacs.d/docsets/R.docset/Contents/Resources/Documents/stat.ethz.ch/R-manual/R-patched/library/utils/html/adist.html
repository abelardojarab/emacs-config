<h2>Approximate String Distances</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute the approximate string distance between character vectors.
The distance is a generalized Levenshtein (edit) distance, giving the
minimal possibly weighted number of insertions, deletions and
substitutions needed to transform one string into another.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>adist(x, y = NULL, costs = NULL, counts = FALSE, fixed = TRUE,
      partial = !fixed, ignore.case = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector.  <a href="../../base/html/LongVectors.html">Long vectors</a> are not supported.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector, or <code>NULL</code> (default) indicating
taking <code>x</code> as <code>y</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>costs</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector or list with names partially matching
<span class="samp">insertions</span>, <span class="samp">deletions</span> and <span class="samp">substitutions</span> giving
the respective costs for computing the Levenshtein distance, or
<code>NULL</code> (default) indicating using unit cost for all three
possible transformations.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>counts</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical indicating whether to optionally return the
transformation counts (numbers of insertions, deletions and
substitutions) as the <code>"counts"</code> attribute of the return
value.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fixed</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical.  If <code>TRUE</code> (default), the <code>x</code>
elements are used as string literals.  Otherwise, they are taken as
regular expressions and <code>partial = TRUE</code> is implied
(corresponding to the approximate string distance used by
<code><a href="../../base/html/agrep.html">agrep</a></code> with <code>fixed = FALSE</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>partial</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical indicating whether the transformed <code>x</code>
elements must exactly match the complete <code>y</code> elements, or only
substrings of these.  The latter corresponds to the approximate
string distance used by <code><a href="../../base/html/agrep.html">agrep</a></code> (by default).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ignore.case</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, case is ignored for
computing the distances.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>useBytes</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical.  If <code>TRUE</code> distance computations are
done byte-by-byte rather than character-by-character.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The (generalized) Levenshtein (or edit) distance between two strings
<var>s</var> and <var>t</var> is the minimal possibly weighted number of
insertions, deletions and substitutions needed to transform <var>s</var>
into <var>t</var> (so that the transformation exactly matches <var>t</var>).
This distance is computed for <code>partial = FALSE</code>, currently using
a dynamic programming algorithm (see, e.g.,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) with space
and time complexity <i>O(mn)</i>, where <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are the
lengths of <var>s</var> and <var>t</var>, respectively.  Additionally computing
the transformation sequence and counts is <i>O(\max(m, n))</i>.
</p>
<p>The generalized Levenshtein distance can also be used for approximate
(fuzzy) string matching, in which case one finds the substring of
<var>t</var> with minimal distance to the pattern <var>s</var> (which could be
taken as a regular expression, in which case the principle of using
the leftmost and longest match applies), see, e.g.,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching.  This
distance is computed for <code>partial = TRUE</code> using <span class="samp">tre</span> by
Ville Laurikari (http://laurikari.net/tre/) and
corresponds to the distance used by <code><a href="../../base/html/agrep.html">agrep</a></code>.  In this
case, the given cost values are coerced to integer.
</p>
<p>Note that the costs for insertions and deletions can be different, in
which case the distance between <var>s</var> and <var>t</var> can be different
from the distance between <var>t</var> and <var>s</var>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix with the approximate string distances of the elements of
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, with rows and columns corresponding to <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code>, respectively.
</p>
<p>If <code>counts</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, the transformation counts are
returned as the <code>"counts"</code> attribute of this matrix, as a
3-dimensional array with dimensions corresponding to the elements of
<code>x</code>, the elements of <code>y</code>, and the type of transformation
(insertions, deletions and substitutions), respectively.
Additionally, if <code>partial = FALSE</code>, the transformation sequences
are returned as the <code>"trafos"</code> attribute of the return value, as
character strings with elements <span class="samp">M</span>, <span class="samp">I</span>, <span class="samp">D</span> and
<span class="samp">S</span> indicating a match, insertion, deletion and substitution,
respectively.  If <code>partial = TRUE</code>, the offsets (positions of
the first and last element) of the matched substrings are returned as
the <code>"offsets"</code> attribute of the return value (with both offsets
<i>-1</i> in case of no match).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>## Cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance
adist("kitten", "sitting")
## To see the transformation counts for the Levenshtein distance:
drop(attr(adist("kitten", "sitting", counts = TRUE), "counts"))
## To see the transformation sequences:
attr(adist(c("kitten", "sitting"), counts = TRUE), "trafos")

## Cf. the examples for agrep:
adist("lasy", "1 lazy 2")
## For a "partial approximate match" (as used for agrep):
adist("lasy", "1 lazy 2", partial = TRUE)
