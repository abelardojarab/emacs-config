<h2>
Annual Mean Sunspot Numbers
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>sunspot</code> is a time series and contains 289 observations.
</p>
<p>The Zurich sunspot numbers have been analyzed in almost all books on time
series analysis as well as numerous papers.  The data set, usually attributed
to Rudolf Wolf, consists of means of daily relative numbers of sunspot 
sightings.
The relative number for a day is given by k(f+10g) where g is the number of
sunspot groups observed, f is the total number of spots within the groups and
k is a scaling factor relating the observer and telescope to a baseline. The
relative numbers are then averaged to give an annual figure.   
See Inzenman (1983) for a discussion of the relative numbers. The figures are
for the years 1700-1988.
