<h2>
Create a Tar Archive
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a tar archive.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>tar(tarfile, files = NULL,
    compression = c("none", "gzip", "bzip2", "xz"),
    compression_level = 6, tar = Sys.getenv("tar"),
    extra_flags = "")
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td><code>tarfile</code></td>
<td>
<p>The pathname of the tar file: tilde expansion (see
<code><a href="../../base/html/path.expand.html">path.expand</a></code>) will be performed.  Alternatively, a
<a href="../../base/html/connections.html">connection</a> that can be used for binary writes.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>files</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of filepaths to be archived:
the default is to archive all files under the current directory.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>compression</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string giving the type of compression to
be used (default none).  Can be abbreviated.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>compression_level</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer: the level of compression.  Only used
for the internal method.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tar</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string: the path to the command to be used.  If
the command itself contains spaces it needs to be quoted (e.g., by
<code><a href="../../base/html/shQuote.html">shQuote</a></code>) – but argument <code>tar</code> can also contain
flags separated from the command by spaces.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>extra_flags</code></td>
<td>
<p>any extra flags for an external <code>tar</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is either a wrapper for a <code>tar</code> command or uses an
internal implementation in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.  The latter is used if <code>tarfile</code>
is a connection or if the argument <code>tar</code> is <code>"internal"</code> or
<code>""</code> (the ‘factory-fresh’ default).  Note that whereas
Unix-alike versions of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> set the environment variable <span class="env">TAR</span>, its
value is not the default for this function.
</p>
<p>Argument <code>extra_flags</code> is passed to an external <code>tar</code> and
so is platform-dependent.  Possibly useful values include <span class="option">-h</span>
(follow symbolic links, also <span class="option">-L</span> on some platforms),
<span class="samp">--acls</span>, <span class="option">--exclude-backups</span>, <span class="option">--exclude-vcs</span> (and
similar) and on Windows <span class="option">--force-local</span> (so drives can be
included in filepaths: however, this is the default for the
<code>Rtools</code> <code>tar</code>).  For GNU <code>tar</code>,
<span class="option">--format=ustar</span> forces a more portable format (the current
default in version 1.26 is <span class="option">--format=gnu</span>, but the manual says
the intention is to change to <span class="option">--format=pax</span> which GNU
incorrectly calls ‘POSIX’ – it was never part of the POSIX
standard for <code>tar</code>).  For libarchive <code>tar</code>,
<span class="option">--format=ustar</span> is more portable than the default.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The return code from <code><a href="../../base/html/system.html">system</a></code> or <code>0</code> for the internal
version, invisibly.
</p>


<h3>Portability</h3>

<p>The ‘tar’ format no longer has an agreed standard!
‘Unix Standard Tar’ was part of POSIX 1003.1:1998 but has been
removed in favour of <code>pax</code>, and in any case many common
implementations diverged from the former standard.  Most <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> platforms
use a version of GNU <code>tar</code> (including <code>Rtools</code> on
Windows, but the behaviour seems to be changed with each version), Mac
OS &gt;= 10.6 and FreeBSD use <code>bsdttar</code> from the ‘libarchive’
project, and commercial Unixes will have their own versions.
</p>
<p>Known problems arise from
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> The handling of file paths of more than 100 bytes.  These were
unsupported in early versions of <code>tar</code>, and supported in one
way by POSIX <code>tar</code> and in another by GNU <code>tar</code> and
yet another by the POSIX <code>pax</code> command which
recent<code>tar</code> programs often support.  The internal
implementation warns on paths of more than 100 bytes,
uses the ‘ustar’ way from the 1998 POSIX
standard which supports up to 256 bytes (depending on the path: in
particular the final component is limited to 100 bytes) if possible,
or the GNU way (which is widely supported).
</p>
<p>Most formats do not record the encoding of file paths.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> (File) links.  <code>tar</code> was developed on an OS that used
hard links, and physical files that were referred to more than once
in the list of files to be included were included only once, the
remaining instances being added as links.  Later a means to include
symbolic links was added.  The internal implementation supports
symbolic links (on OSes that support them), only.  Of course, the
question arises as to how links should be unpacked on OSes that do
not support them: for regular files, at least, file copies can be
used.
</p>
<p>Names of links in the ‘ustar’ format are restricted to 100
bytes.  There is an GNU extension for arbitrarily long link names,
but <code>bsdtar</code> does not read.  The internal method uses the
GNU extension, with a warning.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Header fields, in particular the padding to be used when
fields are not full or not used.  POSIX did define the correct
behaviour but commonly used implementations did (and still do)
not comply.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> File sizes.  The ‘ustar’ format is restricted to 8GB
per (uncompressed) file.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>For portability, avoid file paths of more than 100 bytes and all links
(especially hard links and symbolic links to directories).
</p>
<p>The internal implementation writes only the blocks of 512 bytes
required (including trailing blocks of nuls), unlike GNU <code>tar</code>
which by default pads with <span class="samp">nul</span> to a multiple of 20 blocks
(10KB).  Implementations which pad differ on whether the block padding
should occur before or after compression (or both): padding was
designed for improved performance on physical tape drives.
