<h2>Convert Character Vector between Encodings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This uses system facilities to convert a character vector between
encodings: the ‘i’ stands for ‘internationalization’.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>iconv(x, from = "", to = "", sub = NA, mark = TRUE, toRaw = FALSE)

iconvlist()
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector, or an object to be converted to a character
vector by <code><a href="character.html">as.character</a></code>, or a list with <code>NULL</code> and
<code>raw</code> elements as returned by <code>iconv(toRaw = TRUE)</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>from</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string describing the current encoding.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>to</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string describing the target encoding.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sub</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string.  If not <code>NA</code> it is used to replace
any non-convertible bytes in the input.  (This would normally be a
single character, but can be more.)  If <code>"byte"</code>, the indication is
<code>"&lt;xx&gt;"</code> with the hex code of the byte.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mark</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, for expert use.  Should encodings be marked?</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>toRaw</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical.  Should a list of raw vectors be returned rather
than a character vector?</p>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The names of encodings and which ones are available are
platform-dependent.  All <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> platforms support <code>""</code> (for the
encoding of the current locale), <code>"latin1"</code> and <code>"UTF-8"</code>.
Generally case is ignored when specifying an encoding.
</p>
<p>On most platforms <code>iconvlist</code> provides an alphabetical list of
the supported encodings.  On others, the information is on the man
page for <code>iconv(5)</code> or elsewhere in the man pages (but beware
that the system command <code>iconv</code> may not support the same set of
encodings as the C functions <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> calls).  Unfortunately, the names are
rarely supported across all platforms.
</p>
<p>Elements of <code>x</code> which cannot be converted (perhaps because they
are invalid or because they cannot be represented in the target
encoding) will be returned as <code>NA</code> unless <code>sub</code> is specified.
</p>
<p>Most versions of <code>iconv</code> will allow transliteration by appending
<span class="samp">//TRANSLIT</span> to the <code>to</code> encoding: see the examples.
</p>
<p>Encoding <code>"ASCII"</code> is accepted, and on most systems <code>"C"</code>
and <code>"POSIX"</code> are synonyms for ASCII.
</p>
<p>Any encoding bits (see <code><a href="Encoding.html">Encoding</a></code>) on elements of <code>x</code>
are ignored: they will always be translated as if from encoding
<code>from</code> even if declared otherwise.  <code><a href="Encoding.html">enc2native</a></code> and
<code><a href="Encoding.html">enc2utf8</a></code> provide alternatives which do take declared
encodings into account.
</p>
<p>Note that implementations of <code>iconv</code> typically do not do much
validity checking and will often mis-convert inputs which are invalid
in encoding <code>from</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>toRaw = FALSE</code> (the default), the value is a character vector
of the same length and the same attributes as <code>x</code> (after
conversion to a character vector).
</p>
<p>If <code>mark = TRUE</code> (the default) the elements of the result have a
declared encoding if <code>to</code> is <code>"latin1"</code> or <code>"UTF-8"</code>,
or if <code>to = ""</code> and the current locale's encoding is detected as
Latin-1 (or its superset CP1252 on Windows) or UTF-8.
</p>
<p>If <code>toRaw = TRUE</code>, the value is a list of the same length and
the same attributes as <code>x</code> whose elements are either <code>NULL</code>
(if conversion fails) or a raw vector.
</p>
<p>For <code>iconvlist()</code>, a character vector (typically of a few hundred
elements) of known encoding names.
</p>


<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<p>There are three main implementations of <code>iconv</code> in use.
Linux's C runtime <span class="samp">glibc</span> contains one.  Several platforms
supply GNU <span class="samp">libiconv</span>, including OS X, FreeBSD and Cygwin, in
some cases with additional encodings.  On Windows we use a version of
Yukihiro Nakadaira's <span class="samp">win_iconv</span>, which is based on Windows'
codepages.  (We have added many encoding names for compatibility
with other systems.)  All three have <code>iconvlist</code>, ignore case in
encoding names and support <span class="samp">//TRANSLIT</span> (but with different
results, and for <span class="samp">win_iconv</span> currently a ‘best fit’
strategy is used except for <code>to = "ASCII"</code>).
</p>
<p>Most commercial Unixes contain an implemetation of <code>iconv</code> but
none we have encountered have supported the encoding names we need:
the “R Installation and Administration Manual” recommends
installing GNU <span class="samp">libiconv</span> on Solaris and AIX, for example.
</p>
<p>There are other implementations, e.g.  NetBSD has used one from the
Citrus project (which does not support <span class="samp">//TRANSLIT</span>) and there is
an older FreeBSD port (<span class="samp">libiconv</span> is usually used there): it has
not been reported whether or not these work with <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.
</p>
<p>Note that you cannot rely on invalid inputs being detected, especially
for <code>to = "ASCII"</code> where some implementations allow 8-bit
characters and pass them through unchanged or with transliteration.
</p>
<p>Some of the implementations have interesting extra encodings: for
example GNU <span class="samp">libiconv</span> allows <code>to = "C99"</code> to use
<code>\uxxx</code> escapes for non-ASCII characters.
</p>


<h3>Byte Order Marks</h3>

<p>most commonly known as ‘BOMs’.
</p>
<p>Encodings using character units which are more than one byte in size
can be written on a file in either big-endian or little-endian order:
this applies most commonly to UCS-2, UTF-16 and UTF-32/UCS-4
encodings.  Some systems will write the Unicode character
<code>U+FEFF</code> at the beginning of a file in these encodings and
perhaps also in UTF-8.  In that usage the character is known as a BOM,
and should be handled during input (see the ‘Encodings’ section
under <code><a href="connections.html">connection</a></code>: re-encoded connections have some
special handling of BOMs).  The rest of this section applies when this
has not been done so <code>x</code> starts with a BOM.
</p>
<p>Implementations will generally interpret a BOM for <code>from</code> given
as one of <code>"UCS-2"</code>, <code>"UTF-16"</code> and
<code>"UTF-32"</code>.  Implementations differ in how they treat BOMs in
<code>x</code> in other <code>from</code> encodings: they may be discarded,
returned as character <code>U+FEFF</code> or regarded as invalid.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The only reasonably portable name for the ISO 8859-15 encoding,
commonly known as ‘Latin 9’, is <code>"latin-9"</code>: some
platforms support <code>"latin9"</code> but GNU <span class="samp">libiconv</span> does not.
</p>
<p>Encoding names <code>"utf8"</code>, <code>"mac"</code> and <code>"macroman"</code> are
not portable.  <code>"utf8"</code> is converted to <code>"UTF-8"</code> for
<code>from</code> and <code>to</code> (as from <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 3.0.3) by <code>iconv</code>, but not
for e.g. <code>fileEncoding</code> arguments.  <code>"macintosh"</code> is
the official (and most widely supported) name for ‘Mac Roman’
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>## In principle, as not all systems have iconvlist
try(utils::head(iconvlist(), n = 50))

## Not run: 
## convert from Latin-2 to UTF-8: two of the glibc iconv variants.
iconv(x, "ISO_8859-2", "UTF-8")
iconv(x, "LATIN2", "UTF-8")

## End(Not run)

## Both x below are in latin1 and will only display correctly in a
## locale that can represent and display latin1.
x &lt;- "fa\xE7ile"
Encoding(x) &lt;- "latin1"
x
charToRaw(xx &lt;- iconv(x, "latin1", "UTF-8"))
xx

iconv(x, "latin1", "ASCII")          #   NA
iconv(x, "latin1", "ASCII", "?")     # "fa?ile"
iconv(x, "latin1", "ASCII", "")      # "faile"
iconv(x, "latin1", "ASCII", "byte")  # "fa&lt;e7&gt;ile"

## Extracts from old R help files (they are nowadays in UTF-8)
x &lt;- c("Ekstr\xf8m", "J\xf6reskog", "bi\xdfchen Z\xfcrcher")
Encoding(x) &lt;- "latin1"
x
try(iconv(x, "latin1", "ASCII//TRANSLIT"))  # platform-dependent
iconv(x, "latin1", "ASCII", sub = "byte")
## and for Windows' 'Unicode'
str(xx &lt;- iconv(x, "latin1", "UTF-16LE", toRaw = TRUE))
iconv(xx, "UTF-16LE", "UTF-8")
