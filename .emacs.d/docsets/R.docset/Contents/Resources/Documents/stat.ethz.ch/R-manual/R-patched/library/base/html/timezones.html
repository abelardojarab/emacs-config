<h2>Time Zones</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Information about time zones in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.  <code>Sys.timezone</code> returns
the name of the current time zone.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>Sys.timezone(location = TRUE)

OlsonNames()
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td><code>location</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: should an attempt be made to find the
location name as used in the Olson/IANA database?
(See ‘Time zone names’ below.)</p>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Time zones are a system-specific topic, but these days almost all <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>
platforms use similar underlying code, used by Linux, OS X, Solaris,
AIX, FreeBSD, Sun Java &gt;= 1.4 and Tcl &gt;= 8.5, and installed with <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> on
Windows.  Unfortunately there are many system-specific errors in the
implementations.  It is possible to use <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>'s own version of the code
on Unix-alikes as well as on Windows: this is the default for OS X and
recommended for Solaris.
</p>
<p>It should be possible to set the time zone via the environment
variable <span class="env">TZ</span>: see the section on ‘Time zone names’ for
suitable values.  <code>Sys.timezone()</code> will return the value of
<span class="env">TZ</span> if set (and on some OSes it is always set), otherwise it will
try to retrieve a value which if set for <span class="env">TZ</span> would give the
current time zone.  This is not in general possible, and
<code>Sys.timezone(FALSE)</code> on Windows will retrieve the abbreviation
used for the current time.
</p>
<p>If <span class="env">TZ</span> is set but empty or invalid, most platforms default to
<span class="samp">UTC</span>, the time zone colloquially known as <span class="samp">GMT</span> (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).  (Some
but not all platforms will give a warning for invalid time zones.)
</p>
<p>Time zones did not come into use until the second half of the
nineteenth century and were not widely adopted until the twentieth,
and <em>daylight saving time</em> (DST, also known as <em>summer
time</em>) was first introduced in the early twentieth century, most
widely in 1916. Over the last 100 years places have changed their
affiliation between major time zones, have opted out of (or in to) DST
in various years or adopted DST rule changes late or not at all.
</p>
<p>A quite common system implementation of <code>POSIXct</code> is as signed
32-bit integers and so only goes back to the end of 1901: on such
systems <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> assumes that dates prior to that are in the same time zone
as they were in 1902.  Most of the world had not adopted time zones by
1902 (so used local ‘mean time’ based on longitude) but for a
few places there had been time-zone changes before then.  64-bit
representations are becoming common; unfortunately on some 64-bit OSes
(notably OS X) the database information is 32-bit and so only
available for the range 1901–2038, and incompletely for the end
years.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>Sys.timezone</code> returns an OS-specific character string, possibly
<code>NA</code> or an empty string (which on some OSes means <span class="samp">UTC</span>).
For the default <code>location = TRUE</code> this will be a location such as
<code>"Europe/London"</code> if one can be ascertained.  For <code>location
  = FALSE</code> this may be an abbreviation such as <code>"EST"</code> or
<code>"CEST"</code> on Windows.
</p>
<p><code>OlsonNames</code> returns a character vector.
</p>


<h3>Time zone names</h3>

<p>Names <code>"UTC"</code> and its synonym <code>"GMT"</code> are accepted on all
platforms.
</p>
<p>Where OSes describe their valid time zones can be obscure.  The help
for the C function <code>tzset</code> can be helpful, but it can also be
inaccurate.  There is a cumbersome POSIX specification (listed under
environment variable <span class="env">TZ</span> at
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08),
which is often at least partially supported, but there are other more
user-friendly ways to specify time zones.
</p>
<p>Almost all <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> platforms make use of a time-zone database originally
compiled by Arthur David Olson and now managed by IANA, in which the
preferred way to refer to a time zone is by a location (typically of a
city), e.g., <code>Europe/London</code>, <code>America/Los_Angeles</code>,
<code>Pacific/Easter</code>.  Some traditional designations are also allowed
such as <code>EST5EDT</code> or <code>GB</code>.  (Beware that some of these
designations may not be what you expect: in particular <code>EST</code> is a
time zone used in Canada <em>without</em> daylight saving time, and not
<code>EST5EDT</code> nor (Australian) Eastern Standard Time.)  The
designation can also be an optional colon prepended to the path to a
file giving complied zone information (and the examples above are all
files in a system-specific location).  See
http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm for more details and
references.  By convention, regions with a unique time-zone history
since 1970 have specific names in the database, but those with
different earlier histories may not.  Each time zone has one or two
(the second for DST) <em>abbreviations</em> used when formatting times.
</p>
<p>The abbreviations used have changed over the years: for example France
used <span class="samp">PMT</span> (‘Paris Mean Time’) from 1891 to 1911 then
<span class="samp">WET/WEST</span> up to 1940 and <span class="samp">CET/CEST</span> from 1946.  (In almost
all time zones the abbreviations have been stable since 1970.)  The
POSIX standard allows only one or two abbreviations per time zone, so
you may see the current abbreviation(s) used for older times.
</p>
<p>The function <code>OlsonNames</code> returns the time-zone names known to
the Olson/IANA database on the current system. The system-specific
location in the file system varies, e.g. ‘<span class="file">/usr/share/zoneinfo</span>’
(Linux, OS X, FreeBSD), ‘<span class="file">/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo</span>’ (Solaris, AIX),
....  It is likely that there is a file named something like
‘<span class="file">zone.tab</span>’ under that directory listing the locations known as
time-zone names (but not for example <code>EST5EDT</code>): this is read by
<code>OlsonNames</code>.  See also
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone.tab.
</p>
<p>Where <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> was configured with option <span class="option">--with-internal-tzcode</span>
(the default on OS X and Windows: recommended on Solaris), the database at
<code>file.path(R.home("share"), "zoneinfo")</code> is used by default: file
‘<span class="file">VERSION</span>’ in that directory states the version.  Environment
variable <span class="env">TZDIR</span> can be used to point to a different
‘<span class="file">zoneinfo</span>’ directory: this is also supported by the native
services on some OSes, e.g. Linux).
</p>
<p>Most platforms support time zones of the form <span class="samp">GMT+n</span> and
<span class="samp">GMT-n</span>, which assume at a fixed offset from UTC (hence no DST).
Contrary to some expectations (but consistent with names such as
<span class="samp">PST8PDT</span>), negative offsets are times ahead of (east of) UTC,
positive offsets are times behind (west of) UTC.
</p>
<p>Immediately prior to the advent of legislated time zones, most people
used time based on their longitude (or that of a nearby town), known
as ‘Local Mean Time’ and abbreviated as <span class="samp">LMT</span> in the
databases: in many countries that was codified with a specific name
before the switch to a standard time.  For example, Paris codified its
LMT as ‘Paris Mean Time’ in 1891 (to be used throughout
mainland France) and switched to <span class="samp">GMT+0</span> in 1911.
</p>

<p>Some systems (notably Linux) have <code>tzselect</code> command which
allows the interactive selection of a supported time zone name.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>









<p>There is a system-specific upper limit on the number of bytes in
(abbreviated) time-zone names which can be as low as 6 (as required by
POSIX).  Some OSes allow the setting of time zones with names which
exceed their limit, and that can crash the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> session.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Since 2007 there has been considerable disruption over changes to the
timings of the DST transitions, aimed at energy conservation.  These
often have short notice and time-zone databases may not be up to date.
(Morocco in 2013 announced a change to the end of DST at <em>a days</em>
notice, and in 2015 North Korea gave imprecise information about a
change a week in advance.)
</p>
<p>On platforms with case-insensitive file systems, time zone names will be
case-insensitive.  They may or may not be on other platforms and so,
for example, <code>"gmt"</code> is valid on some platforms and not on others.
</p>
<p>Note that except where replaced, the operation of time zones is an OS
service, and even where replaced a third-party database is used and
can be updated (see the section on ‘Time zone names’).
Incorrect results will never be an <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> issue, so please ensure that you
have the courtesy not to blame <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> for them.
