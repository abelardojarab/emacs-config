<h2>Date Conversion Functions to and from Character</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions to convert between character representations and objects of
class <code>"Date"</code> representing calendar dates.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>as.Date(x, ...)
## S3 method for class 'character'
as.Date(x, format, ...)
## S3 method for class 'numeric'
as.Date(x, origin, ...)
## S3 method for class 'POSIXct'
as.Date(x, tz = "UTC", ...)

## S3 method for class 'Date'
format(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'Date'
as.character(x, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object to be converted.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>format</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string.  If not specified, it will try
<code>"%Y-%m-%d"</code> then <code>"%Y/%m/%d"</code> on the first
non-<code>NA</code> element, and give an error if neither works.
Otherwise, the processing is via <code><a href="strptime.html">strptime</a></code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>origin</code></td>
<td>
<p>a Date object, or something which can be coerced by
<code>as.Date(origin, ...)</code> to such an object.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tz</code></td>
<td>
<p>a time zone name.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Further arguments to be passed from or to other methods,
including <code>format</code> for <code>as.character</code> and <code>as.Date</code>
methods.</p>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The usual vector re-cycling rules are applied to <code>x</code> and
<code>format</code> so the answer will be of length that of the longer of the
vectors.
</p>
<p>Locale-specific conversions to and from character strings are used
where appropriate and available.  This affects the names of the days
and months.
</p>
<p>The <code>as.Date</code> methods accept character strings, factors, logical
<code>NA</code> and objects of classes <code>"<a href="DateTimeClasses.html">POSIXlt</a>"</code> and
<code>"<a href="DateTimeClasses.html">POSIXct</a>"</code>.  (The last is converted to days by ignoring
the time after midnight in the representation of the time in specified
time zone, default UTC.)  Also objects of class <code>"date"</code> (from
package <span class="pkg">date</span>) and <code>"dates"</code> (from
package <span class="pkg">chron</span>).  Character strings are processed
as far as necessary for the format specified: any trailing characters
are ignored.
</p>
<p><code>as.Date</code> will accept numeric data (the number of days since an
epoch), but <em>only</em> if <code>origin</code> is supplied.
</p>
<p>The <code>format</code> and <code>as.character</code> methods ignore any
fractional part of the date.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The <code>format</code> and <code>as.character</code> methods return a character vector
representing the date.  <code>NA</code> dates are returned as <code>NA_character_</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>as.Date</code> methods return an object of class <code>"<a href="Dates.html">Date</a>"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Conversion from other Systems</h3>

<p>Most systems record dates internally as the number of days since some
origin, but this is fraught with problems, including
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Is the origin day 0 or day 1?  As the ‘Examples’ show,
Excel manages to use both choices for its two date systems.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If the origin is far enough back, the designers may show their
ignorance of calendar systems.  For example, Excel's designer
thought 1900 was a leap year (claiming to copy the error from
earlier DOS spreadsheets), and Matlab's designer chose the
non-existent date of ‘January 0, 0000’ (there is no such day),
not specifying the calendar.  (There is such a year in the
‘Gregorian’ calendar as used in ISO 8601:2004, but that does say
that it is only to be used for years before 1582 with the agreement
of the parties in information exchange.)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The only safe procedure is to check the other systems values for known
dates: reports on the Internet (including R-help) are more often wrong
than right.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The default formats follow the rules of the ISO 8601 international
standard which expresses a day as <code>"2001-02-03"</code>.
</p>
<p>If the date string does not specify the date completely, the returned
answer may be system-specific.  The most common behaviour is to assume
that a missing year, month or day is the current one.  If it specifies
a date incorrectly, reliable implementations will give an error and
the date is reported as <code>NA</code>.  Unfortunately some common
implementations (such as <span class="samp">glibc</span>) are unreliable and guess at the
intended meaning.
</p>
<p>Years before 1CE (aka 1AD) will probably not be handled correctly.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>## locale-specific version of the date
format(Sys.Date(), "%a %b %d")

## read in date info in format 'ddmmmyyyy'
## This will give NA(s) in some locales; setting the C locale
## as in the commented lines will overcome this on most systems.
## lct &lt;- Sys.getlocale("LC_TIME"); Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "C")
x &lt;- c("1jan1960", "2jan1960", "31mar1960", "30jul1960")
z &lt;- as.Date(x, "%d%b%Y")
## Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", lct)
z

## read in date/time info in format 'm/d/y'
dates &lt;- c("02/27/92", "02/27/92", "01/14/92", "02/28/92", "02/01/92")
as.Date(dates, "%m/%d/%y")

## date given as number of days since 1900-01-01 (a date in 1989)
as.Date(32768, origin = "1900-01-01")
## Excel is said to use 1900-01-01 as day 1 (Windows default) or
## 1904-01-01 as day 0 (Mac default), but this is complicated by Excel
## incorrectly treating 1900 as a leap year.
## So for dates (post-1901) from Windows Excel
as.Date(35981, origin = "1899-12-30") # 1998-07-05
## and Mac Excel
as.Date(34519, origin = "1904-01-01") # 1998-07-05
## (these values come from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214330)

## Experiment shows that Matlab's origin is 719529 days before ours,
## (it takes the non-existent 0000-01-01 as day 1)
## so Matlab day 734373 can be imported as
as.Date(734373, origin = "1970-01-01") - 719529 # 2010-08-23
## (value from 
## http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/matlab/matlab_prog/represent-date-and-times-in-MATLAB.html)

## Time zone effect
z &lt;- ISOdate(2010, 04, 13, c(0,12)) # midnight and midday UTC
as.Date(z) # in UTC
## these time zone names are common
as.Date(z, tz = "NZ")
as.Date(z, tz = "HST") # Hawaii
