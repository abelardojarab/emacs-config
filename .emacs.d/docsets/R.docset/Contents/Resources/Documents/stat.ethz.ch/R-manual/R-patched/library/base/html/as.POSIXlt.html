<h2>Date-time Conversion Functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions to manipulate objects of classes <code>"POSIXlt"</code> and
<code>"POSIXct"</code> representing calendar dates and times.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>as.POSIXct(x, tz = "", ...)
as.POSIXlt(x, tz = "", ...)

## S3 method for class 'character'
as.POSIXlt(x, tz = "", format, ...)

## S3 method for class 'numeric'
as.POSIXlt(x, tz = "", origin, ...)

## S3 method for class 'POSIXlt'
as.double(x, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object to be converted.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tz</code></td>
<td>
<p>A time zone specification to be used for the conversion,
<em>if one is required</em>.  System-specific (see <a href="timezones.html">time zones</a>),
but <code>""</code> is the current time zone, and <code>"GMT"</code> is UTC
(Universal Time, Coordinated). Invalid values are most commonly
treated as UTC, on some platforms with a warning.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>further arguments to be passed to or from other methods.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>format</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string giving a date-time format as used
by <code><a href="strptime.html">strptime</a></code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>origin</code></td>
<td>
<p>a date-time object, or something which can be coerced by
<code>as.POSIXct(tz = "GMT")</code> to such an object.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>as.POSIX*</code> functions convert an object to one of the two
classes used to represent date/times (calendar dates plus time to the
nearest second).  They can convert a wide variety of objects,
including objects of the other class and of classes <code>"Date"</code>,
<code>"date"</code> (from package <span class="pkg">date</span>),
<code>"chron"</code> and <code>"dates"</code> (from package
<span class="pkg">chron</span>) to these classes.  Dates without times are
treated as being at midnight UTC.
</p>
<p>They can also convert character strings of the formats
<code>"2001-02-03"</code> and <code>"2001/02/03"</code> optionally followed by
white space and a time in the format <code>"14:52"</code> or
<code>"14:52:03"</code>.  (Formats such as <code>"01/02/03"</code> are ambiguous
but can be converted via a format specification by
<code><a href="strptime.html">strptime</a></code>.)  Fractional seconds are allowed.
Alternatively, <code>format</code> can be specified for character vectors or
factors: if it is not specified and no standard format works for
all non-<code>NA</code> inputs an error is thrown.
</p>
<p>If <code>format</code> is specified, remember that some of the format
specifications are locale-specific, and you may need to set the
<code>LC_TIME</code> category appropriately <em>via</em>
<code><a href="locales.html">Sys.setlocale</a></code>.  This most often affects the use of
<code>%b</code>, <code>%B</code> (month names) and <code>%p</code> (AM/PM).
</p>
<p>Logical <code>NA</code>s can be converted to either of the classes, but no
other logical vectors can be.
</p>
<p>If you are given a numeric time as the number of seconds since an
epoch, see the examples.
</p>
<p>Character input is first converted to class <code>"POSIXlt"</code> by
<code><a href="strptime.html">strptime</a></code>: numeric input is first converted to
<code>"POSIXct"</code>.  Any conversion that needs to go between the two
date-time classes requires a time zone: conversion from
<code>"POSIXlt"</code> to <code>"POSIXct"</code> will validate times in the
selected time zone.  One issue is what happens at transitions
to and from DST, for example in the UK
</p>
<pre>as.POSIXct(strptime("2011-03-27 01:30:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
as.POSIXct(strptime("2010-10-31 01:30:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
</pre>
<p>are respectively invalid (the clocks went forward at 1:00 GMT to 2:00
BST) and ambiguous (the clocks went back at 2:00 BST to 1:00 GMT).  What
happens in such cases is OS-specific: one should expect the first to
be <code>NA</code>, but the second could be interpreted as either BST or
GMT (and common OSes give both possible values).  Note too (see
<code><a href="strptime.html">strftime</a></code>) that OS facilities may not format invalid
times correctly.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>as.POSIXct</code> and <code>as.POSIXlt</code> return an object of the
appropriate class.  If <code>tz</code> was specified, <code>as.POSIXlt</code>
will give an appropriate <code>"tzone"</code> attribute.  Date-times known
to be invalid will be returned as <code>NA</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Some of the concepts used have to be extended backwards in time (the
usage is said to be ‘proleptic’).  For example, the origin of
time for the <code>"POSIXct"</code> class, ‘1970-01-01 00:00.00 UTC’,
is before UTC was defined.  More importantly, conversion is done
assuming the Gregorian calendar which was introduced in 1582 and not
used universally until the 20th century.  One of the
re-interpretations assumed by ISO 8601:2004 is that there was a year
zero, even though current year numbering (and zero) is a much later
concept (525 AD for year numbers from 1 AD).
</p>
<p>If you want to extract specific aspects of a time (such as the day of
the week) just convert it to class <code>"POSIXlt"</code> and extract the
relevant component(s) of the list, or if you want a character
representation (such as a named day of the week) use the
<code>format</code> method.
</p>
<p>If a time zone is needed and that specified is invalid on your system,
what happens is system-specific but attempts to set it will probably
be ignored.
</p>
<p>Conversion from character needs to find a suitable format unless one
is supplied (by trying common formats in turn): this can be slow for
long inputs.
