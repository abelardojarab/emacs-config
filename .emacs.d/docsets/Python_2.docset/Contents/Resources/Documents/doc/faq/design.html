<div class="section" id="why-does-python-use-indentation-for-grouping-of-statements">
<h2>Why does Python use indentation for grouping of statements?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-does-python-use-indentation-for-grouping-of-statements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Guido van Rossum believes that using indentation for grouping is extremely
elegant and contributes a lot to the clarity of the average Python program.
Most people learn to love this feature after a while.</p>
<p>Since there are no begin/end brackets there cannot be a disagreement between
grouping perceived by the parser and the human reader.  Occasionally C
programmers will encounter a fragment of code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>if (x &lt;= y)
        x++;
        y--;
z++;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Only the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x++</span></code> statement is executed if the condition is true, but the
indentation leads you to believe otherwise.  Even experienced C programmers will
sometimes stare at it a long time wondering why <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code> is being decremented even
for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">y</span></code>.</p>
<p>Because there are no begin/end brackets, Python is much less prone to
coding-style conflicts.  In C there are many different ways to place the braces.
If you&#8217;re used to reading and writing code that uses one style, you will feel at
least slightly uneasy when reading (or being required to write) another style.</p>
<p>Many coding styles place begin/end brackets on a line by themselves.  This makes
programs considerably longer and wastes valuable screen space, making it harder
to get a good overview of a program.  Ideally, a function should fit on one
screen (say, 20-30 lines).  20 lines of Python can do a lot more work than 20
lines of C.  This is not solely due to the lack of begin/end brackets &#8211; the
lack of declarations and the high-level data types are also responsible &#8211; but
the indentation-based syntax certainly helps.</p>

<h2>Why are floating point calculations so inaccurate?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-floating-point-calculations-so-inaccurate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>People are often very surprised by results like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mf">1.2</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mf">1.0</span>
<span class="go">0.19999999999999996</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and think it is a bug in Python. It&#8217;s not.  This has nothing to do with Python,
but with how the underlying C platform handles floating point numbers, and
ultimately with the inaccuracies introduced when writing down numbers as a
string of a fixed number of digits.</p>
<p>The internal representation of floating point numbers uses a fixed number of
binary digits to represent a decimal number.  Some decimal numbers can&#8217;t be
represented exactly in binary, resulting in small roundoff errors.</p>
<p>In decimal math, there are many numbers that can&#8217;t be represented with a fixed
number of decimal digits, e.g.  1/3 = 0.3333333333.......</p>
<p>In base 2, 1/2 = 0.1, 1/4 = 0.01, 1/8 = 0.001, etc.  .2 equals 2/10 equals 1/5,
resulting in the binary fractional number 0.001100110011001...</p>
<p>Floating point numbers only have 32 or 64 bits of precision, so the digits are
cut off at some point, and the resulting number is 0.199999999999999996 in
decimal, not 0.2.</p>
<p>A floating point number&#8217;s <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repr()</span></code> function prints as many digits are
necessary to make <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval(repr(f))</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">f</span></code> true for any float f.  The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">str()</span></code>
function prints fewer digits and this often results in the more sensible number
that was probably intended:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mf">1.1</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mf">0.9</span>
<span class="go">0.20000000000000007</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span> <span class="mf">1.1</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mf">0.9</span>
<span class="go">0.2</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>One of the consequences of this is that it is error-prone to compare the result
of some computation to a float with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">==</span></code>. Tiny inaccuracies may mean that
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">==</span></code> fails.  Instead, you have to check that the difference between the two
numbers is less than a certain threshold:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">epsilon</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.0000000000001</span>  <span class="c"># Tiny allowed error</span>
<span class="n">expected_result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.4</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">expected_result</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">epsilon</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">computation</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">expected_result</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">epsilon</span><span class="p">:</span>

<div class="section" id="why-are-python-strings-immutable">
<h2>Why are Python strings immutable?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-python-strings-immutable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are several advantages.</p>
<p>One is performance: knowing that a string is immutable means we can allocate
space for it at creation time, and the storage requirements are fixed and
unchanging.  This is also one of the reasons for the distinction between tuples
and lists.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that strings in Python are considered as &#8220;elemental&#8221; as
numbers.  No amount of activity will change the value 8 to anything else, and in
Python, no amount of activity will change the string &#8220;eight&#8221; to anything else.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-must-self-be-used-explicitly-in-method-definitions-and-calls">
<span id="why-self"></span><h2>Why must &#8216;self&#8217; be used explicitly in method definitions and calls?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-must-self-be-used-explicitly-in-method-definitions-and-calls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The idea was borrowed from Modula-3.  It turns out to be very useful, for a
variety of reasons.</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s more obvious that you are using a method or instance attribute
instead of a local variable.  Reading <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">self.x</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">self.meth()</span></code> makes it
absolutely clear that an instance variable or method is used even if you don&#8217;t
know the class definition by heart.  In C++, you can sort of tell by the lack of
a local variable declaration (assuming globals are rare or easily recognizable)
&#8211; but in Python, there are no local variable declarations, so you&#8217;d have to
look up the class definition to be sure.  Some C++ and Java coding standards
call for instance attributes to have an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m_</span></code> prefix, so this explicitness is
still useful in those languages, too.</p>
<p>Second, it means that no special syntax is necessary if you want to explicitly
reference or call the method from a particular class.  In C++, if you want to
use a method from a base class which is overridden in a derived class, you have
to use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">::</span></code> operator &#8211; in Python you can write
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">baseclass.methodname(self,</span> <span class="pre">&lt;argument</span> <span class="pre">list&gt;)</span></code>.  This is particularly useful
for <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__" title="object.__init__"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__()</span></code></a> methods, and in general in cases where a derived class
method wants to extend the base class method of the same name and thus has to
call the base class method somehow.</p>
<p>Finally, for instance variables it solves a syntactic problem with assignment:
since local variables in Python are (by definition!) those variables to which a
value is assigned in a function body (and that aren&#8217;t explicitly declared
global), there has to be some way to tell the interpreter that an assignment was
meant to assign to an instance variable instead of to a local variable, and it
should preferably be syntactic (for efficiency reasons).  C++ does this through
declarations, but Python doesn&#8217;t have declarations and it would be a pity having
to introduce them just for this purpose.  Using the explicit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">self.var</span></code> solves
this nicely.  Similarly, for using instance variables, having to write
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">self.var</span></code> means that references to unqualified names inside a method don&#8217;t
have to search the instance&#8217;s directories.  To put it another way, local
variables and instance variables live in two different namespaces, and you need
to tell Python which namespace to use.</p>

<h2>Why can&#8217;t I use an assignment in an expression?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-can-t-i-use-an-assignment-in-an-expression" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many people used to C or Perl complain that they want to use this C idiom:</p>
<div class="highlight-c"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// do something with line</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where in Python you&#8217;re forced to write this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>
    <span class="o">...</span> <span class="c"># do something with line</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The reason for not allowing assignment in Python expressions is a common,
hard-to-find bug in those other languages, caused by this construct:</p>
<div class="highlight-c"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// error handling</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// code that only works for nonzero x</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The error is a simple typo: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">0</span></code>, which assigns 0 to the variable <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code>,
was written while the comparison <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">0</span></code> is certainly what was intended.</p>
<p>Many alternatives have been proposed.  Most are hacks that save some typing but
use arbitrary or cryptic syntax or keywords, and fail the simple criterion for
language change proposals: it should intuitively suggest the proper meaning to a
human reader who has not yet been introduced to the construct.</p>
<p>An interesting phenomenon is that most experienced Python programmers recognize
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">while</span> <span class="pre">True</span></code> idiom and don&#8217;t seem to be missing the assignment in
expression construct much; it&#8217;s only newcomers who express a strong desire to
add this to the language.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an alternative way of spelling this that seems attractive but is
generally less robust than the &#8220;while True&#8221; solution:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="o">...</span> <span class="c"># do something with line...</span>
    <span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The problem with this is that if you change your mind about exactly how you get
the next line (e.g. you want to change it into <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sys.stdin.readline()</span></code>) you
have to remember to change two places in your program &#8211; the second occurrence
is hidden at the bottom of the loop.</p>
<p>The best approach is to use iterators, making it possible to loop through
objects using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></code> statement.  For example, in the current version of
Python file objects support the iterator protocol, so you can now write simply:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>

<div class="section" id="why-does-python-use-methods-for-some-functionality-e-g-list-index-but-functions-for-other-e-g-len-list">
<h2>Why does Python use methods for some functionality (e.g. list.index()) but functions for other (e.g. len(list))?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-does-python-use-methods-for-some-functionality-e-g-list-index-but-functions-for-other-e-g-len-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The major reason is history. Functions were used for those operations that were
generic for a group of types and which were intended to work even for objects
that didn&#8217;t have methods at all (e.g. tuples).  It is also convenient to have a
function that can readily be applied to an amorphous collection of objects when
you use the functional features of Python (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">map()</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">zip()</span></code> et al).</p>
<p>In fact, implementing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">len()</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max()</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">min()</span></code> as a built-in function is
actually less code than implementing them as methods for each type.  One can
quibble about individual cases but it&#8217;s a part of Python, and it&#8217;s too late to
make such fundamental changes now. The functions have to remain to avoid massive
code breakage.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">For string operations, Python has moved from external functions (the

<h2>Why is join() a string method instead of a list or tuple method?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-join-a-string-method-instead-of-a-list-or-tuple-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Strings became much more like other standard types starting in Python 1.6, when
methods were added which give the same functionality that has always been
available using the functions of the string module.  Most of these new methods
have been widely accepted, but the one which appears to make some programmers
feel uncomfortable is:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s">&quot;, &quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">&#39;1&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;2&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;4&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;8&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;16&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which gives the result:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s">&quot;1, 2, 4, 8, 16&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There are two common arguments against this usage.</p>
<p>The first runs along the lines of: &#8220;It looks really ugly using a method of a
string literal (string constant)&#8221;, to which the answer is that it might, but a
string literal is just a fixed value. If the methods are to be allowed on names
bound to strings there is no logical reason to make them unavailable on
literals.</p>
<p>The second objection is typically cast as: &#8220;I am really telling a sequence to
join its members together with a string constant&#8221;.  Sadly, you aren&#8217;t.  For some
reason there seems to be much less difficulty with having <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#str.split" title="str.split"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">split()</span></code></a> as
a string method, since in that case it is easy to see that</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s">&quot;1, 2, 4, 8, 16&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;, &quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>is an instruction to a string literal to return the substrings delimited by the
given separator (or, by default, arbitrary runs of white space).  In this case a
Unicode string returns a list of Unicode strings, an ASCII string returns a list
of ASCII strings, and everyone is happy.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#str.join" title="str.join"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">join()</span></code></a> is a string method because in using it you are telling the
separator string to iterate over a sequence of strings and insert itself between
adjacent elements.  This method can be used with any argument which obeys the
rules for sequence objects, including any new classes you might define yourself.</p>
<p>Because this is a string method it can work for Unicode strings as well as plain
ASCII strings.  If <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">join()</span></code> were a method of the sequence types then the
sequence types would have to decide which type of string to return depending on
the type of the separator.</p>
<p>If none of these arguments persuade you, then for the moment you can continue to
use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">join()</span></code> function from the string module, which allows you to write</p>

There have been some proposals for switch statement syntax, but there is no

complete details and the current status.</p>
<p>For cases where you need to choose from a very large number of possibilities,
you can create a dictionary mapping case values to functions to call.  For
example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>def function_1(...):
    ...

functions = {&#39;a&#39;: function_1,
             &#39;b&#39;: function_2,
             &#39;c&#39;: self.method_1, ...}

func = functions[value]
func()
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For calling methods on objects, you can simplify yet further by using the
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#getattr" title="getattr"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">getattr()</span></code></a> built-in to retrieve methods with a particular name:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">visit_a</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>

</div>
<p>It&#8217;s suggested that you use a prefix for the method names, such as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">visit_</span></code> in

<p>Answer 1: Unfortunately, the interpreter pushes at least one C stack frame for
each Python stack frame.  Also, extensions can call back into Python at almost
random moments.  Therefore, a complete threads implementation requires thread
support for C.</p>

<h2>Why can&#8217;t lambda expressions contain statements?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-can-t-lambda-expressions-contain-statements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python lambda expressions cannot contain statements because Python&#8217;s syntactic
framework can&#8217;t handle statements nested inside expressions.  However, in
Python, this is not a serious problem.  Unlike lambda forms in other languages,
where they add functionality, Python lambdas are only a shorthand notation if
you&#8217;re too lazy to define a function.</p>
<p>Functions are already first class objects in Python, and can be declared in a
local scope.  Therefore the only advantage of using a lambda instead of a
locally-defined function is that you don&#8217;t need to invent a name for the
function &#8211; but that&#8217;s just a local variable to which the function object (which
is exactly the same type of object that a lambda expression yields) is assigned!</p>

<div class="section" id="can-python-be-compiled-to-machine-code-c-or-some-other-language">
<h2>Can Python be compiled to machine code, C or some other language?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-python-be-compiled-to-machine-code-c-or-some-other-language" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Not easily.  Python&#8217;s high level data types, dynamic typing of objects and
run-time invocation of the interpreter (using <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#eval" title="eval"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval()</span></code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/simple_stmts.html#exec"><code class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">exec</span></code></a>)
together mean that a &#8220;compiled&#8221; Python program would probably consist mostly of
calls into the Python run-time system, even for seemingly simple operations like
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x+1</span></code>.</p>
<p>Several projects described in the Python newsgroup or at past <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/community/workshops/">Python
conferences</a> have shown that this
approach is feasible, although the speedups reached so far are only modest
(e.g. 2x).  Jython uses the same strategy for compiling to Java bytecode.  (Jim
Hugunin has demonstrated that in combination with whole-program analysis,
speedups of 1000x are feasible for small demo programs.  See the proceedings
from the <a class="reference external" href="http://legacy.python.org/workshops/1997-10/proceedings/">1997 Python conference</a> for more information.)</p>
<p>Internally, Python source code is always translated into a bytecode
representation, and this bytecode is then executed by the Python virtual
machine.  In order to avoid the overhead of repeatedly parsing and translating
modules that rarely change, this byte code is written into a file whose name
ends in &#8221;.pyc&#8221; whenever a module is parsed.  When the corresponding .py file is
changed, it is parsed and translated again and the .pyc file is rewritten.</p>
<p>There is no performance difference once the .pyc file has been loaded, as the
bytecode read from the .pyc file is exactly the same as the bytecode created by
direct translation.  The only difference is that loading code from a .pyc file
is faster than parsing and translating a .py file, so the presence of
precompiled .pyc files improves the start-up time of Python scripts.  If
desired, the Lib/compileall.py module can be used to create valid .pyc files for
a given set of modules.</p>
<p>Note that the main script executed by Python, even if its filename ends in .py,
is not compiled to a .pyc file.  It is compiled to bytecode, but the bytecode is
not saved to a file.  Usually main scripts are quite short, so this doesn&#8217;t cost
much speed.</p>
<p>There are also several programs which make it easier to intermingle Python and C
code in various ways to increase performance.  See, for example, <a class="reference external" href="http://cython.org/">Cython</a> , <a class="reference external" href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/">Psyco</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/">Pyrex</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://pyinline.sourceforge.net/">PyInline</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2cmod/">Py2Cmod</a>, and

<div class="section" id="how-does-python-manage-memory">
<h2>How does Python manage memory?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-python-manage-memory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The details of Python memory management depend on the implementation.  The
standard C implementation of Python uses reference counting to detect
inaccessible objects, and another mechanism to collect reference cycles,
periodically executing a cycle detection algorithm which looks for inaccessible
cycles and deletes the objects involved. The <a class="reference internal" href="../library/gc.html#module-gc" title="gc: Interface to the cycle-detecting garbage collector."><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">gc</span></code></a> module provides functions
to perform a garbage collection, obtain debugging statistics, and tune the
collector&#8217;s parameters.</p>
<p>Jython relies on the Java runtime so the JVM&#8217;s garbage collector is used.  This
difference can cause some subtle porting problems if your Python code depends on
the behavior of the reference counting implementation.</p>
<p>Sometimes objects get stuck in tracebacks temporarily and hence are not
deallocated when you might expect.  Clear the tracebacks with:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
<span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exc_clear</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exc_traceback</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">last_traceback</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Tracebacks are used for reporting errors, implementing debuggers and related
things.  They contain a portion of the program state extracted during the
handling of an exception (usually the most recent exception).</p>
<p>In the absence of circularities and tracebacks, Python programs do not need to
manage memory explicitly.</p>
<p>Why doesn&#8217;t Python use a more traditional garbage collection scheme?  For one
thing, this is not a C standard feature and hence it&#8217;s not portable.  (Yes, we
know about the Boehm GC library.  It has bits of assembler code for <em>most</em>
common platforms, not for all of them, and although it is mostly transparent, it
isn&#8217;t completely transparent; patches are required to get Python to work with
it.)</p>
<p>Traditional GC also becomes a problem when Python is embedded into other
applications.  While in a standalone Python it&#8217;s fine to replace the standard
malloc() and free() with versions provided by the GC library, an application
embedding Python may want to have its <em>own</em> substitute for malloc() and free(),
and may not want Python&#8217;s.  Right now, Python works with anything that
implements malloc() and free() properly.</p>
<p>In Jython, the following code (which is fine in CPython) will probably run out
of file descriptors long before it runs out of memory:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="nb">file</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">very_long_list_of_files</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">file</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Using the current reference counting and destructor scheme, each new assignment
to f closes the previous file.  Using GC, this is not guaranteed.  If you want
to write code that will work with any Python implementation, you should
explicitly close the file or use the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts.html#with"><code class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">with</span></code></a> statement; this will work
regardless of GC:</p>

<h2>Why isn&#8217;t all memory freed when Python exits?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-isn-t-all-memory-freed-when-python-exits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Objects referenced from the global namespaces of Python modules are not always
deallocated when Python exits.  This may happen if there are circular
references.  There are also certain bits of memory that are allocated by the C
library that are impossible to free (e.g. a tool like Purify will complain about
these).  Python is, however, aggressive about cleaning up memory on exit and
does try to destroy every single object.</p>

<h2>Why are there separate tuple and list data types?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-there-separate-tuple-and-list-data-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lists and tuples, while similar in many respects, are generally used in
fundamentally different ways.  Tuples can be thought of as being similar to
Pascal records or C structs; they&#8217;re small collections of related data which may
be of different types which are operated on as a group.  For example, a
Cartesian coordinate is appropriately represented as a tuple of two or three
numbers.</p>
<p>Lists, on the other hand, are more like arrays in other languages.  They tend to
hold a varying number of objects all of which have the same type and which are
operated on one-by-one.  For example, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">os.listdir('.')</span></code> returns a list of
strings representing the files in the current directory.  Functions which
operate on this output would generally not break if you added another file or
two to the directory.</p>
<p>Tuples are immutable, meaning that once a tuple has been created, you can&#8217;t
replace any of its elements with a new value.  Lists are mutable, meaning that
you can always change a list&#8217;s elements.  Only immutable elements can be used as
dictionary keys, and hence only tuples and not lists can be used as keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-are-lists-implemented">
<h2>How are lists implemented?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-are-lists-implemented" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python&#8217;s lists are really variable-length arrays, not Lisp-style linked lists.
The implementation uses a contiguous array of references to other objects, and
keeps a pointer to this array and the array&#8217;s length in a list head structure.</p>
<p>This makes indexing a list <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a[i]</span></code> an operation whose cost is independent of
the size of the list or the value of the index.</p>
<p>When items are appended or inserted, the array of references is resized.  Some
cleverness is applied to improve the performance of appending items repeatedly;
when the array must be grown, some extra space is allocated so the next few
times don&#8217;t require an actual resize.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-are-dictionaries-implemented">
<h2>How are dictionaries implemented?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-are-dictionaries-implemented" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python&#8217;s dictionaries are implemented as resizable hash tables.  Compared to
B-trees, this gives better performance for lookup (the most common operation by
far) under most circumstances, and the implementation is simpler.</p>
<p>Dictionaries work by computing a hash code for each key stored in the dictionary
using the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#hash" title="hash"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">hash()</span></code></a> built-in function.  The hash code varies widely depending
on the key; for example, &#8220;Python&#8221; hashes to -539294296 while &#8220;python&#8221;, a string
that differs by a single bit, hashes to 1142331976.  The hash code is then used
to calculate a location in an internal array where the value will be stored.
Assuming that you&#8217;re storing keys that all have different hash values, this
means that dictionaries take constant time &#8211; O(1), in computer science notation
&#8211; to retrieve a key.  It also means that no sorted order of the keys is
maintained, and traversing the array as the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.keys()</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.items()</span></code> do will
output the dictionary&#8217;s content in some arbitrary jumbled order.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-must-dictionary-keys-be-immutable">
<h2>Why must dictionary keys be immutable?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-must-dictionary-keys-be-immutable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The hash table implementation of dictionaries uses a hash value calculated from
the key value to find the key.  If the key were a mutable object, its value
could change, and thus its hash could also change.  But since whoever changes
the key object can&#8217;t tell that it was being used as a dictionary key, it can&#8217;t
move the entry around in the dictionary.  Then, when you try to look up the same
object in the dictionary it won&#8217;t be found because its hash value is different.
If you tried to look up the old value it wouldn&#8217;t be found either, because the
value of the object found in that hash bin would be different.</p>
<p>If you want a dictionary indexed with a list, simply convert the list to a tuple
first; the function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tuple(L)</span></code> creates a tuple with the same entries as the
list <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">L</span></code>.  Tuples are immutable and can therefore be used as dictionary keys.</p>
<p>Some unacceptable solutions that have been proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Hash lists by their address (object ID).  This doesn&#8217;t work because if you
construct a new list with the same value it won&#8217;t be found; e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mydict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="s">&#39;12&#39;</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">mydict</span><span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>would raise a KeyError exception because the id of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[1,</span> <span class="pre">2]</span></code> used in the
second line differs from that in the first line.  In other words, dictionary
keys should be compared using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">==</span></code>, not using <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/expressions.html#is"><code class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">is</span></code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Make a copy when using a list as a key.  This doesn&#8217;t work because the list,
being a mutable object, could contain a reference to itself, and then the
copying code would run into an infinite loop.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Allow lists as keys but tell the user not to modify them.  This would allow a
class of hard-to-track bugs in programs when you forgot or modified a list by
accident. It also invalidates an important invariant of dictionaries: every
value in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">d.keys()</span></code> is usable as a key of the dictionary.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Mark lists as read-only once they are used as a dictionary key.  The problem
is that it&#8217;s not just the top-level object that could change its value; you
could use a tuple containing a list as a key.  Entering anything as a key into
a dictionary would require marking all objects reachable from there as
read-only &#8211; and again, self-referential objects could cause an infinite loop.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a trick to get around this if you need to, but use it at your own risk:
You can wrap a mutable structure inside a class instance which has both a
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__" title="object.__eq__"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__eq__()</span></code></a> and a <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__" title="object.__hash__"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__hash__()</span></code></a> method.  You must then make sure that the
hash value for all such wrapper objects that reside in a dictionary (or other
hash based structure), remain fixed while the object is in the dictionary (or
other structure).</p>

<p>Note that the hash computation is complicated by the possibility that some
members of the list may be unhashable and also by the possibility of arithmetic
overflow.</p>
<p>Furthermore it must always be the case that if <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">o1</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">o2</span></code> (ie <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">o1.__eq__(o2)</span>

regardless of whether the object is in a dictionary or not.  If you fail to meet
these restrictions dictionaries and other hash based structures will misbehave.</p>
<p>In the case of ListWrapper, whenever the wrapper object is in a dictionary the
wrapped list must not change to avoid anomalies.  Don&#8217;t do this unless you are
prepared to think hard about the requirements and the consequences of not
meeting them correctly.  Consider yourself warned.</p>

<p>In situations where performance matters, making a copy of the list just to sort
it would be wasteful. Therefore, <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">list.sort()</span></code> sorts the list in place. In
order to remind you of that fact, it does not return the sorted list.  This way,
you won&#8217;t be fooled into accidentally overwriting a list when you need a sorted
copy but also need to keep the unsorted version around.</p>
<p>In Python 2.4 a new built-in function &#8211; <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#sorted" title="sorted"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">sorted()</span></code></a> &#8211; has been added.
This function creates a new list from a provided iterable, sorts it and returns
it.  For example, here&#8217;s how to iterate over the keys of a dictionary in sorted

<h2>How do you specify and enforce an interface spec in Python?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-you-specify-and-enforce-an-interface-spec-in-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An interface specification for a module as provided by languages such as C++ and
Java describes the prototypes for the methods and functions of the module.  Many
feel that compile-time enforcement of interface specifications helps in the
construction of large programs.</p>
<p>Python 2.6 adds an <a class="reference internal" href="../library/abc.html#module-abc" title="abc: Abstract base classes according to PEP 3119."><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">abc</span></code></a> module that lets you define Abstract Base Classes
(ABCs).  You can then use <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#isinstance" title="isinstance"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">isinstance()</span></code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#issubclass" title="issubclass"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">issubclass()</span></code></a> to check
whether an instance or a class implements a particular ABC.  The
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/collections.html#module-collections" title="collections: High-performance datatypes"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">collections</span></code></a> module defines a set of useful ABCs such as
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/collections.html#collections.Iterable" title="collections.Iterable"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Iterable</span></code></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../library/collections.html#collections.Container" title="collections.Container"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Container</span></code></a>, and
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/collections.html#collections.MutableMapping" title="collections.MutableMapping"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">MutableMapping</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>For Python, many of the advantages of interface specifications can be obtained
by an appropriate test discipline for components.  There is also a tool,
PyChecker, which can be used to find problems due to subclassing.</p>
<p>A good test suite for a module can both provide a regression test and serve as a
module interface specification and a set of examples.  Many Python modules can
be run as a script to provide a simple &#8220;self test.&#8221;  Even modules which use
complex external interfaces can often be tested in isolation using trivial
&#8220;stub&#8221; emulations of the external interface.  The <a class="reference internal" href="../library/doctest.html#module-doctest" title="doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings."><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">doctest</span></code></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/unittest.html#module-unittest" title="unittest: Unit testing framework for Python."><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">unittest</span></code></a> modules or third-party test frameworks can be used to construct
exhaustive test suites that exercise every line of code in a module.</p>
<p>An appropriate testing discipline can help build large complex applications in
Python as well as having interface specifications would.  In fact, it can be
better because an interface specification cannot test certain properties of a
program.  For example, the <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">append()</span></code> method is expected to add new elements
to the end of some internal list; an interface specification cannot test that
your <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">append()</span></code> implementation will actually do this correctly, but it&#8217;s
trivial to check this property in a test suite.</p>
<p>Writing test suites is very helpful, and you might want to design your code with
an eye to making it easily tested.  One increasingly popular technique,
test-directed development, calls for writing parts of the test suite first,
before you write any of the actual code.  Of course Python allows you to be
sloppy and not write test cases at all.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-is-there-no-goto">
<h2>Why is there no goto?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-there-no-goto" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can use exceptions to provide a &#8220;structured goto&#8221; that even works across
function calls.  Many feel that exceptions can conveniently emulate all
reasonable uses of the &#8220;go&#8221; or &#8220;goto&#8221; constructs of C, Fortran, and other
languages.  For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">label</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">pass</span>  <span class="c"># declare a label</span>

<span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
     <span class="o">...</span>
     <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">condition</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="n">label</span><span class="p">()</span>  <span class="c"># goto label</span>

<span class="k">except</span> <span class="n">label</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="c"># where to goto</span>
     <span class="k">pass</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t allow you to jump into the middle of a loop, but that&#8217;s usually
considered an abuse of goto anyway.  Use sparingly.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-can-t-raw-strings-r-strings-end-with-a-backslash">

<p>More precisely, they can&#8217;t end with an odd number of backslashes: the unpaired
backslash at the end escapes the closing quote character, leaving an
unterminated string.</p>
<p>Raw strings were designed to ease creating input for processors (chiefly regular
expression engines) that want to do their own backslash escape processing. Such
processors consider an unmatched trailing backslash to be an error anyway, so
raw strings disallow that.  In return, they allow you to pass on the string
quote character by escaping it with a backslash.  These rules work well when
r-strings are used for their intended purpose.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re trying to build Windows pathnames, note that all Windows system calls

<div class="section" id="why-doesn-t-python-have-a-with-statement-for-attribute-assignments">
<h2>Why doesn&#8217;t Python have a &#8220;with&#8221; statement for attribute assignments?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-doesn-t-python-have-a-with-statement-for-attribute-assignments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python has a &#8216;with&#8217; statement that wraps the execution of a block, calling code
on the entrance and exit from the block.  Some language have a construct that
looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>               <span class="c"># equivalent to obj.a = 1</span>
    <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>   <span class="c"># obj.total = obj.total + 1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In Python, such a construct would be ambiguous.</p>
<p>Other languages, such as Object Pascal, Delphi, and C++, use static types, so
it&#8217;s possible to know, in an unambiguous way, what member is being assigned
to. This is the main point of static typing &#8211; the compiler <em>always</em> knows the
scope of every variable at compile time.</p>
<p>Python uses dynamic types. It is impossible to know in advance which attribute
will be referenced at runtime. Member attributes may be added or removed from
objects on the fly. This makes it impossible to know, from a simple reading,
what attribute is being referenced: a local one, a global one, or a member
attribute?</p>
<p>For instance, take the following incomplete snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The snippet assumes that &#8220;a&#8221; must have a member attribute called &#8220;x&#8221;.  However,
there is nothing in Python that tells the interpreter this. What should happen
if &#8220;a&#8221; is, let us say, an integer?  If there is a global variable named &#8220;x&#8221;,
will it be used inside the with block?  As you see, the dynamic nature of Python
makes such choices much harder.</p>
<p>The primary benefit of &#8220;with&#8221; and similar language features (reduction of code
volume) can, however, easily be achieved in Python by assignment.  Instead of:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mydict</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">21</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>write this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">ref</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mydict</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">ref</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">21</span>
<span class="n">ref</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">42</span>
<span class="n">ref</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">63</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This also has the side-effect of increasing execution speed because name
bindings are resolved at run-time in Python, and the second version only needs
to perform the resolution once.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-are-colons-required-for-the-if-while-def-class-statements">
<h2>Why are colons required for the if/while/def/class statements?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-colons-required-for-the-if-while-def-class-statements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The colon is required primarily to enhance readability (one of the results of
the experimental ABC language).  Consider this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>if a == b
    print a
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>versus</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Notice how the second one is slightly easier to read.  Notice further how a
colon sets off the example in this FAQ answer; it&#8217;s a standard usage in English.</p>
<p>Another minor reason is that the colon makes it easier for editors with syntax
highlighting; they can look for colons to decide when indentation needs to be
increased instead of having to do a more elaborate parsing of the program text.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-does-python-allow-commas-at-the-end-of-lists-and-tuples">
<h2>Why does Python allow commas at the end of lists and tuples?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-does-python-allow-commas-at-the-end-of-lists-and-tuples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python lets you add a trailing comma at the end of lists, tuples, and
dictionaries:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,]</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;c&#39;</span><span class="p">,)</span>
<span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s">&quot;A&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="s">&quot;B&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">],</span>  <span class="c"># last trailing comma is optional but good style</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There are several reasons to allow this.</p>
<p>When you have a literal value for a list, tuple, or dictionary spread across
multiple lines, it&#8217;s easier to add more elements because you don&#8217;t have to
remember to add a comma to the previous line.  The lines can also be reordered
without creating a syntax error.</p>
<p>Accidentally omitting the comma can lead to errors that are hard to diagnose.
For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="s">&quot;fee&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s">&quot;fie&quot;</span>
  <span class="s">&quot;foo&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s">&quot;fum&quot;</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This list looks like it has four elements, but it actually contains three:
&#8220;fee&#8221;, &#8220;fiefoo&#8221; and &#8220;fum&#8221;.  Always adding the comma avoids this source of error.</p>
<p>Allowing the trailing comma may also make programmatic code generation easier.</p>
