<p>Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.  It
incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data
types, and classes.  Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.
It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various
window systems, and is extensible in C or C++.  It is also usable as an
extension language for applications that need a programmable interface.
Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on
PCs under MS-DOS, Windows, Windows NT, and OS/2.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Why was Python created in the first place?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#why-was-python-created-in-the-first-place" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <em>very</em> brief summary of what started it all, written by Guido van
Rossum:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I had extensive experience with implementing an interpreted language in the
ABC group at CWI, and from working with this group I had learned a lot about
language design.  This is the origin of many Python features, including the
use of indentation for statement grouping and the inclusion of
very-high-level data types (although the details are all different in
Python).</p>
<p>I had a number of gripes about the ABC language, but also liked many of its
features.  It was impossible to extend the ABC language (or its
implementation) to remedy my complaints &#8211; in fact its lack of extensibility
was one of its biggest problems.  I had some experience with using Modula-2+
and talked with the designers of Modula-3 and read the Modula-3 report.
Modula-3 is the origin of the syntax and semantics used for exceptions, and
some other Python features.</p>
<p>I was working in the Amoeba distributed operating system group at CWI.  We
needed a better way to do system administration than by writing either C
programs or Bourne shell scripts, since Amoeba had its own system call
interface which wasn&#8217;t easily accessible from the Bourne shell.  My
experience with error handling in Amoeba made me acutely aware of the
importance of exceptions as a programming language feature.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that a scripting language with a syntax like ABC but with
access to the Amoeba system calls would fill the need.  I realized that it
would be foolish to write an Amoeba-specific language, so I decided that I
needed a language that was generally extensible.</p>
<p>During the 1989 Christmas holidays, I had a lot of time on my hand, so I
decided to give it a try.  During the next year, while still mostly working
on it in my own time, Python was used in the Amoeba project with increasing
success, and the feedback from colleagues made me add many early
improvements.</p>
<p>In February 1991, after just over a year of development, I decided to post to
USENET.  The rest is in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Misc/HISTORY</span></code> file.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">What is Python good for?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-python-good-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied
to many different classes of problems.</p>
<p>The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as
string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between
files), Internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP, CGI
programming), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing
Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP
sockets).  Look at the table of contents for <a class="reference internal" href="../library/index.html#library-index"><span>The Python Standard Library</span></a> to get an idea
of what&#8217;s available.  A wide variety of third-party extensions are also
available.  Consult <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">the Python Package Index</a> to
find packages of interest to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-does-the-python-version-numbering-scheme-work">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">How does the Python version numbering scheme work?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-the-python-version-numbering-scheme-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Python versions are numbered A.B.C or A.B.  A is the major version number &#8211; it
is only incremented for really major changes in the language.  B is the minor
version number, incremented for less earth-shattering changes.  C is the
micro-level &#8211; it is incremented for each bugfix release.  See <span class="target" id="index-0"></span><a class="pep reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0006"><strong>PEP 6</strong></a> for more
information about bugfix releases.</p>
<p>Not all releases are bugfix releases.  In the run-up to a new major release, a
series of development releases are made, denoted as alpha, beta, or release
candidate.  Alphas are early releases in which interfaces aren&#8217;t yet finalized;
it&#8217;s not unexpected to see an interface change between two alpha releases.
Betas are more stable, preserving existing interfaces but possibly adding new
modules, and release candidates are frozen, making no changes except as needed
to fix critical bugs.</p>
<p>Alpha, beta and release candidate versions have an additional suffix.  The
suffix for an alpha version is &#8220;aN&#8221; for some small number N, the suffix for a
beta version is &#8220;bN&#8221; for some small number N, and the suffix for a release
candidate version is &#8220;cN&#8221; for some small number N.  In other words, all versions
labeled 2.0aN precede the versions labeled 2.0bN, which precede versions labeled
2.0cN, and <em>those</em> precede 2.0.</p>
<p>You may also find version numbers with a &#8220;+&#8221; suffix, e.g. &#8220;2.2+&#8221;.  These are
unreleased versions, built directly from the Subversion trunk.  In practice,
after a final minor release is made, the Subversion trunk is incremented to the
next minor version, which becomes the &#8220;a0&#8221; version,
e.g. &#8220;2.4a0&#8221;.</p>

<p>When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the
published scripts from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python">&#8220;Monty Python&#8217;s Flying Circus&#8221;</a>, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s.  Van Rossum
thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he
decided to call the language Python.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">How stable is Python?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#how-stable-is-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Very stable.  New, stable releases have been coming out roughly every 6 to 18
months since 1991, and this seems likely to continue.  Currently there are
usually around 18 months between major releases.</p>
<p>The developers issue &#8220;bugfix&#8221; releases of older versions, so the stability of
existing releases gradually improves.  Bugfix releases, indicated by a third
component of the version number (e.g. 2.5.3, 2.6.2), are managed for stability;
only fixes for known problems are included in a bugfix release, and it&#8217;s
guaranteed that interfaces will remain the same throughout a series of bugfix
releases.</p>
<p>The latest stable releases can always be found on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/download/">Python download page</a>.  There are two recommended production-ready
versions at this point in time, because at the moment there are two branches of
stable releases: 2.x and 3.x.  Python 3.x may be less useful than 2.x, since
currently there is more third party software available for Python 2 than for
Python 3.  Python 2 code will generally not run unchanged in Python 3.</p>

<p>In general, no.  There are already millions of lines of Python code around the
world, so any change in the language that invalidates more than a very small
fraction of existing programs has to be frowned upon.  Even if you can provide a
conversion program, there&#8217;s still the problem of updating all documentation;
many books have been written about Python, and we don&#8217;t want to invalidate them
all at a single stroke.</p>
<p>Providing a gradual upgrade path is necessary if a feature has to be changed.

<div class="section" id="is-python-a-good-language-for-beginning-programmers">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id26">Is Python a good language for beginning programmers?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#is-python-a-good-language-for-beginning-programmers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It is still common to start students with a procedural and statically typed
language such as Pascal, C, or a subset of C++ or Java.  Students may be better
served by learning Python as their first language.  Python has a very simple and
consistent syntax and a large standard library and, most importantly, using
Python in a beginning programming course lets students concentrate on important
programming skills such as problem decomposition and data type design.  With
Python, students can be quickly introduced to basic concepts such as loops and
procedures.  They can probably even work with user-defined objects in their very
first course.</p>
<p>For a student who has never programmed before, using a statically typed language
seems unnatural.  It presents additional complexity that the student must master
and slows the pace of the course.  The students are trying to learn to think
like a computer, decompose problems, design consistent interfaces, and
encapsulate data.  While learning to use a statically typed language is
important in the long term, it is not necessarily the best topic to address in
the students&#8217; first programming course.</p>
<p>Many other aspects of Python make it a good first language.  Like Java, Python
has a large standard library so that students can be assigned programming
projects very early in the course that <em>do</em> something.  Assignments aren&#8217;t
restricted to the standard four-function calculator and check balancing
programs.  By using the standard library, students can gain the satisfaction of
working on realistic applications as they learn the fundamentals of programming.
Using the standard library also teaches students about code reuse.  Third-party
modules such as PyGame are also helpful in extending the students&#8217; reach.</p>
<p>Python&#8217;s interactive interpreter enables students to test language features
while they&#8217;re programming.  They can keep a window with the interpreter running
while they enter their program&#8217;s source in another window.  If they can&#8217;t
remember the methods for a list, they can do something like this:</p>

<p>With the interpreter, documentation is never far from the student as he&#8217;s
programming.</p>
<p>There are also good IDEs for Python.  IDLE is a cross-platform IDE for Python
that is written in Python using Tkinter.  PythonWin is a Windows-specific IDE.
Emacs users will be happy to know that there is a very good Python mode for
Emacs.  All of these programming environments provide syntax highlighting,
auto-indenting, and access to the interactive interpreter while coding.  Consult

of Python editing environments.</p>

<p>Starting with Python2.3, the distribution includes the <cite>PyBSDDB package
&lt;http://pybsddb.sf.net/&gt;</cite> as a replacement for the old bsddb module.  It
includes functions which provide backward compatibility at the API level, but
requires a newer version of the underlying <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sleepycat.com">Berkeley DB</a> library.  Files created with the older bsddb module
can&#8217;t be opened directly using the new module.</p>
<p>Using your old version of Python and a pair of scripts which are part of Python
2.3 (db2pickle.py and pickle2db.py, in the Tools/scripts directory) you can
convert your old database files to the new format.  Using your old Python
version, run the db2pickle.py script to convert it to a pickle, e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>python2.2 &lt;pathto&gt;/db2pickley.py database.db database.pck
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Rename your database file:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mv database.db olddatabase.db
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now convert the pickle file to a new format database:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>python &lt;pathto&gt;/pickle2db.py database.db database.pck
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The precise commands you use will vary depending on the particulars of your
installation.  For full details about operation of these two scripts check the
doc string at the start of each one.</p>
