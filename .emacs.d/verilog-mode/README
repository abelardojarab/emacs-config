TESTS

Make sure both emacs and xemacs are installed and "make test".  Testing can run on multiple cores with "make -j 10 test".

Under the hood this is (mostly) running 0test.el.  This reads in each file
under tests/ directory, autos, reindents, and compares the result to the
matching filename in the tests_ok directory.

Test failures generally look like this:

   diff -c tests_ok/autoinout_ma.v e/t/autoinout_ma.v
   ***Golden Reference File
   ---Generated Test File
   --- GOLDEN_REFERENCE
   +++ CURRENT_BEHAVIOR
   ...
   -   output sina,
   +   output siuna,
   To promote current to golden, in shell buffer hit newline anywhere in next line (^P RETURN):
   cp e/t/autoinout_ma.v tests_ok/autoinout_ma.v; VERILOG_MODE_START_FILE=tests_ok/autoinout_ma.v make test_emacs

This indicates the generated output doesn't match what is in tests_ok.  To
fix this make sure that the change is expected then do the "cp" shown to
update the golden references:

   cp e/t/autoinout_ma.v tests_ok/autoinout_ma.v

Then "make test" again.  The suggested VERILOG_MODE_START_FILE can also be
used to jump right to that individual test inside the "make test"
