(defvar helm-descbinds-mode nil "\
Non-nil if Helm-Descbinds mode is enabled.
See the `helm-descbinds-mode' command
for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `helm-descbinds-mode'.")
(custom-autoload 'helm-descbinds-mode "helm-descbinds" nil)
(autoload 'helm-descbinds-mode "helm-descbinds" "\
Use `helm' for `describe-bindings'.

When this mode is enabled, pressing `C-h' after a prefix key
e.g. `C-x' will pop up a helm buffer showing all the keys starting
with this prefix, one can then execute the command bound to this key,
look at the docstring or find the definition of this command.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Helm-Descbinds mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='helm-descbinds-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

(autoload 'helm-descbinds "helm-descbinds" "\
A convenient helm version of `describe-bindings'.

Turning on `helm-descbinds-mode' is the recommended way to
install this command to replace `describe-bindings'.

You complete against a list of keys + command pairs presented in
a similar way as `describe-bindings' does, split into sections
defined by the types of the key bindings (minor and major modes,
global bindings, etc).

The default action executes a command as if the binding had been
entered, or narrows the commands according to a prefix key,
respectively.

The persistent action pops up a help buffer for the selected
command without quitting.

For key translation maps, the default actions are not very
useful, yet they are listed for completeness.
