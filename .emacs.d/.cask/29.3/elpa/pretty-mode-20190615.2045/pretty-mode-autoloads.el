Pretty mode builds on `font-lock-mode'. Instead of highlighting
keywords, it replaces them with symbols. For example, lambda is
displayed as Î» in lisp modes.

Toggle Pretty mode in all buffers.
With prefix ARG, enable Global Pretty mode if ARG is positive;
otherwise, disable it.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.
Enable the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

Pretty mode is enabled in all buffers where
`turn-on-pretty-if-desired' would do it.

See `pretty-mode' for more information on Pretty mode.
