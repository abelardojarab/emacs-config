;; #Pallet
;; Pallet is a package management helper for Emacs.
;; 
;; It uses @rejeep's excellent
;; [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) as a platform to keep
;; track of your installed packages.
;; 
;; ##News
;; Version 0.9 introduces support for Cask version and VC references,
;; which will now be retained if specified in your Cask file:
;; ```
;; (depends-on "graphene" "20141030.219")
;; (depends-on "pallet" :git "https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet" :ref "master")
;; ```
;; Many thanks to [Sam Brightman](https://github.com/sambrightman) for
;; implementing this feature.
;; 
;; Version 0.8 introduces the `;;;pallet-ignore` comment, which allows
;; you to tell Pallet to ignore (and retain) text following the comment.
;; 
;; Version 0.7 introduces a significant breaking change: it is now
;; necessary to start `pallet-mode` for pallet to track your package
;; installs and deletes. See the instructions below.
;; 
;; Version 0.7 introduces a new integration test harness using
;; [Servant](https://github.com/cask/servant). This is intended to allow
;; safer and quicker addition of new features going forward.
;; 
;; ##Target platform
;; Pallet is currently tested with Emacs versions 24.3 through 24.4.
;; 
;; ##Use
;; Pallet has a very simple interface:
;; - `M-x pallet-init` creates a Cask file using information about
;;   installed packages from the package.el system
;; - `M-x pallet-install` installs packages listed in your Cask file
;; - `M-x pallet-update` updates installed packages
;; 
;; Pallet's main job, though, is to add and delete package references
;; from your Cask file as you install and delete them using the built-in
;; Emacs package management system. Turn this on by adding `(pallet-mode
;; t)` to your Emacs init file, or by calling `pallet-mode` interactively (`M-x
;; pallet-mode`).
;; 
;; ##Installation
;; To install pallet, you should first install Cask, following the
;; instructions [here](http://cask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). **At present,
;; just install Cask -- don't add anything to your .emacs or init.el file**.
;; 
;; After installing Cask, there are two ways you can go, depending on
;; your situation:
;; 
;; 1. **I have a working Emacs install, with packages already installed,
;;    and can access [Melpa](http://melpa.org).**
;; 
;;    In this case run `M-x list-packages`, and install pallet.  Then,
;;    run `M-x pallet-init`. Now you have a Cask file in your emacs.d
;;    directory which contains listings for all files you've previously
;;    installed via `package-install`. Run `M-x pallet-install`, and your
;;    .emacs.d/elpa directory will be replicated under .emacs.d/.cask/.
;; 
;;    You can if you wish now delete your .emacs.d/elpa directory, and
;;    remove any lines from your init.el adding archives to
;;    `package-archive`, or running `package-initialize`.
;; 
;; 2. **I have a newly installed Emacs and/or am not set up to access
;;    Melpa.**
;; 
;;    In this case, create a file called `Cask` in your emacs.d
;;    directory. Add the following lines to it:
;; 
;;    ```lisp
;;    (source melpa)
;; 
;;    (depends-on "pallet")
;;    ```
;; 
;;    Then, in terminal and in your emacs.d directory, run
;; 
;;    ```
;;    cask install
;;    ```
;; 
;;    This will create a .cask directory inside your .emacs.d directory,
;;    initialize a package directory under .emacs.d/.cask/, and install
;;    pallet to it.
;; 
;; **Finally, make sure the following lines are in your init.el, before any
;;   packages are required:**
;; 
;; ```lisp
;; (require 'cask "<path-to-cask>/cask.el")
;; (cask-initialize)
;; (require 'pallet)
;; (pallet-mode t)
;; ```
;; 
;; `<path-to-cask>` will vary depending on how you installed Cask: if you
;; installed via the `curl` method, it is likely to be `~/.cask`; if you
;; installed via Homebrew, it is likely to be
;; `/usr/local/Cellar/cask/<version>`.
;; 
;; If you want pallet to maintain your Cask file automatically as you
;; install and delete packages using Emacs' built-in package-management,
;; enable `pallet-mode` by calling `(pallet-mode t)`. You can enable or
;; disable `pallet-mode` at any time by interactively calling
;; `pallet-mode` (`M-x pallet-mode`).
;; 
;; ##Ignoring a section of your Cask file
;; If you prefer to have Pallet ignore part of your Cask file (e.g. so
;; you can use Cask's
;; [VC dependencies](http://cask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/dsl.html#dependencies)),
;; use the `;;;pallet-ignore` comment. Pallet will ignore any text after
;; this comment.
;; ```lisp
;; (source melpa)
;; (depends-on "s")
;; ;;;pallet-ignore
;; (depends-on "newlisp" :git
;; "https://github.com/coldnew/newlisp-mode.git")
;; ```
;; 
;; ##Contributing
;; Contributions to pallet are very welcome.
;; 
;; Fork and clone the repo, then run `git
;; submodule update --init`, which will install
;; [el.mk](http://github.com/rdallasgray/el.mk).
;; 
;; ###Simple testing
;; Install [Cask](http://cask.readthedocs.org/en/latest).
;; 
;; Then run `cask install` to install development dependencies. You
;; should now be able to run the tests: `make test`.
;; 
;; ###Complete testing
;; The pallet dev setup includes a Vagrantfile, which allows pallet to be
;; tested against a selection of recent Emacs releases.
;; 
;; Having installed [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com), add the necessary
;; box by running:
;; ```bash
;; vagrant box add trusty-server \
;; https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-i386-vagrant-disk1.box
;; ```
;; 
;; Then run `vagrant up`. This may take a while, as several versions of
;; Emacs may be downloaded and installed from source.
;; 
;; Shell into the vm by running `vagrant ssh`, and run the tests using
;; `./test_all.sh`. This will run the complete test suite against all
;; installed Emacs versions.
;; 
;; ###Pull requests
;; Any new feature or fix should be covered by tests -- see the files
;; in /test for guidance on how to write your own. When you've
;; created your feature or fix, make a pull request against master in this repo.
