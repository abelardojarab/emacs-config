;;; Commentary:
;;
;; hideshow-org.el provides an org-mode like interface to the
;; hideshow.el file.
;;
;; org-mode provides an elegant means of interacting with outlines
;; that one can toggle with the TAB key and Shift TAB.
;; hideshow-org.el is my attempt to bring the org-mode like hiding and
;; showing to code.

;;; Keymaps:

;; I set this as my global key.
;;
;; (global-set-key "\C-ch" 'hs-org/minor-mode)
;;
;; Here are the keys in the minor mode.
;;
;; TAB       -- execute normal TAB command, if point doesn't move, try to
;;              toggle the visibility of the block.
;; <S-tab>   -- execute normal <S-tab> command, if point doesn't move, try to
;;              toggle the visibility of all the blocks.
;;
;;; Notes:
;;
;; The hardest part was trying to figure out when TAB should behave
;; normally: for code that usually means some variant of *-ident-line
;; (and is incidentally one of the reason I love emacs); for outlines
;; in org-mode that means toggling the visibility.  So the solution I
;; came up with is this.  If TAB doesn't change the point, then we try
;; to hide or show the block.  And we do a similar thing for Shift
;; TAB.  Hopefully, this will be sufficient such that
;; hs-org/minor-mode does not get in the way of anyone's normal
;; programming habits.
;; 
;; Many thanks to the developers of hideshow.el.  Thanks to
;; yasnippets.el for showing me how one could piggyback on an already
;; bound key.
