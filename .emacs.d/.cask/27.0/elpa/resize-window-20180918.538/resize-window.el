;;; Commentary:
;; Easily allows you to resize windows.  Rather than guessing that you
;; want `C-u 17 C-x {`, you could just press FFff, which enlarges 5
;; lines, then 5 lines, then one and then one.  The idea is that the
;; normal motions n,p,f,b along with r for reset and w for cycling
;; windows allows for super simple resizing of windows.  All of this is
;; inside of a while loop so that you don't have to invoke more chords
;; to resize again, but just keep using standard motions until you are
;; happy.

;; But, just run `M-x resize-window`. There are only a few commands to learn,
;; and they mimic the normal motions in emacs.

;;   n : Makes the window vertically bigger, think scrolling down. Use
;;        N  to enlarge 5 lines at once.
;;   p : Makes the window vertically smaller, again, like scrolling. Use
;;        P  to shrink 5 lines at once.
;;   f : Makes the window horizontally bigger, like scrolling forward;
;;        F  for five lines at once.
;;   b : window horizontally smaller,  B  for five lines at once.
;;   r : reset window layout to standard
;;   w : cycle through windows so that you can adjust other window
;;       panes.  W  cycles in the opposite direction.
;;   2 : create a new horizontal split
;;   3 : create a new vertical split
;;   0 : delete the current window
;;   k : kill all buffers and put window config on the stack
;;   y : make the window configuration according to the last config
;;   pushed onto the stack
;;   ? : Display menu listing commands
