:PREAMBLE: RMSbolt is a compiler output viewer in Emacs.

   RMSbolt tries to make it easy to see what your compiler is doing.  It
does this by showing you the assembly output of a given source code
file.  It also highlights which source code a given assembly block
corresponds to, and vice versa.  It supports more types of languages
than any previous tool of its kind.

1 Installation
**************

A melpa package (https://melpa.org/#/rmsbolt) is available for rmsbolt.

   No dependencies are required, other than an Emacs newer than 25.1
* Menu:

* Quelpa::


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: Quelpa,  Up: Installation

1.1 Quelpa
==========

This is a quelpa formula for RMSbolt

     (quelpa '(rmsbolt
     	  :files (:defaults "starters")
     	  :fetcher gitlab
     	  :repo "jgkamat/rmsbolt"))

2 Running
*********

Once installed, use the ‘rmsbolt-starter’ command to generate starter
files, or enable ‘rmsbolt-mode’ in a supported language.  Then run
‘rmsbolt-compile’ or use the default ‘C-c C-c’ binding to pop open a
disassembly buffer.  After the first run, the buffer should
automatically update.

3 Configuring
*************

RMSbolt is primarily configured with Emacs local variables.  This lets
you change compiler and rmsbolt options simply by editing a local
variable block.  The starter files have this block with some common
settings:

     // Local Variables:
     // rmsbolt-command: "gcc -O0"
     // rmsbolt-disassemble: nil
     // End:

   *Note*: the Local Variable block must be 3000 characters from the end
of the file to work
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables).
Any method of setting buffer-local variables will work though.
* Menu:

* Option List::


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: Option List,  Up: Configuring

3.1 Option List
===============

   • Local Option: rmsbolt-command

     Determines the prefix of the compilation command to use.  Use this
     to switch between compilers or pass flags to your compiler.

   • Local Option: rmsbolt-default-directory

     Determines the default directory to compile from, which is useful
     if you are building with a build-system.

   • Local Option: rmsbolt-disassemble

     Disassemble from a compiled binary with objdump, if supported.

   • Local Option: rmsbolt-filter-directives

     Whether to filter unused assembly directives out of final output.

   • Local Option: rmsbolt-filter-labels

     Whether to filter unused labels from final output

   • Local Option: rmsbolt-filter-comment-only

     Whether to filter lines that are comment-only.

   • Local Option: rmsbolt-asm-format

     Which output format to use.  Supported values vary between
     languages.  In general, ~"intel"~ and ~"att"~ are supported.  ‘nil’
     means to use the tool’s defaults.  Other values may work as well,
     depending on your compiler.

   • Local Option: rmsbolt-demangle

     Demangle the output, if supported.

   • Local Option: rmsbolt-ignore-binary-limit

     Ignore the binary size limit for disassembly.  This will almost
     certainly cause Emacs to hang during large processing.

   • Local Option: rmsbolt-demangle

     Enable or disable demangling, if the language supports it.

File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: C/C++,  Next: OCaml,  Up: Languages

4.1 C/C++
=========

C/C++ is the primary focus of support, and will get new features and
support first.

   Demangling is enabled if ‘c++filt’ is available on the path.


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: OCaml,  Next: Rust,  Prev: C/C++,  Up: Languages

4.2 OCaml
=========

OCaml disassembly is supported through both ‘ocamlopt’ and through
disassembly with objdump.


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: Rust,  Next: Haskell,  Prev: OCaml,  Up: Languages

4.3 Rust
========

Demangling is done with ‘rustfilt’ if it is on the path.


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: Haskell,  Next: Python,  Prev: Rust,  Up: Languages

4.4 Haskell
===========

Demangling is done with the compiler-explorer demangler, named to
‘haskell-demangler’ and placed on the path.


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: Python,  Next: Java,  Prev: Haskell,  Up: Languages

4.5 Python
==========

Support for viewing bytecode only.  Python doesn’t have many options
(https://bugs.python.org/issue2506), so most tweakables will not work.
Python 3.7 is required for recursion into functions, otherwise only top
level code will be shown.  Python 2 is completely unsupported.


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: Java,  Next: PHP,  Prev: Python,  Up: Languages

4.6 Java
========

Parses the output of ‘javap’ to get debug information and disassembly.


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: PHP,  Next: Pony,  Prev: Java,  Up: Languages

4.7 PHP
=======

Requires the vld php extension (https://github.com/derickr/vld) to
display PHP opcodes.  Without that, you will not get any output.

   If you use hack (denoted by ‘<hh?’ at the top of your file), you will
not get source->asm matching or filtering.


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: Pony,  Next: Emacs Lisp,  Prev: PHP,  Up: Languages

4.8 Pony
========

Filtering on pony is not as effective as pony asm includes references to
machine-generated functions.  This means the output will be slower to
generate, similar to disassembly in other languages.  The pony file
being viewed will be copied into it’s own directory, making it much
harder to view non-toy examples.


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: Emacs Lisp,  Next: Common Lisp,  Prev: Pony,  Up: Languages

4.9 Emacs Lisp
==============

No support for source->asm matching, filtering, or automatic recompile.

   Emacs 26 or the ‘cl-print’ package are required.


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: Common Lisp,  Prev: Emacs Lisp,  Up: Languages

4.10 Common Lisp
================

No support for source->asm matching or filtering.  Only ‘sbcl’ and
‘clisp’ supported at the moment, with ‘sbcl’ giving much better results.


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: Integrations,  Next: Developing,  Prev: Languages,  Up: Top

5 Integrations
**************

This section covers integrations that RMSbolt provides, which make it
easier to use RMSbolt with complex projects with many dependencies.

   Integrations are very new, and as such, may be highly buggy and
require extra work to debug.

   Most integrations only take effect when ‘rmsbolt-command’ and
‘rmsbolt-default-directory’ are nil!  Setting either of these will
disable any attempt at using the integration system.
* Menu:

* C/C++: C/C++x.


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: C/C++x,  Up: Integrations

5.1 C/C++
=========

C/C++ will look for a ‘compile_commands.json’ file in any directory
higher than the source file.  Once it finds one, it will parse the file
trying to find a match for the current file, and if it finds one, it
will compile using the flags present there.  Many files (like headers)
are not present in ‘compile_commands.json’ and will not work (at this
time).

   Because the compilation commands in ‘compile_commands.json’ assume
the files are compiled in order, please make sure to fully compile the
project before beginning, otherwise, you could see compiler errors.

   In order to transform the given file, some flags are removed.  This
is the most brittle part of the current system, and could cause compile
errors.

   On projects with a lot of imports, the resulting assembly file might
be large, which may cause Emacs to hang.

File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: QuickStart Guide,  Up: C/C++x

5.1.1 QuickStart Guide
----------------------

  1. Generate a ‘compile_commands.json’ file, and ensure it is in a
     domineering directory.
          cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 .
  2. Compile the project completely.  If you pass flags to your build
     system, make sure they are passed when generating
     ‘compile_commands.json’ as well.
  3. Open the file in question, and enable ‘rmsbolt-mode’.
  4. Run ‘rmsbolt-compile’.

6 Developing
************

These are some tips which will help people working on developing or
customizing RMSbolt.
* Menu:

* Adding a Language::


File: rmsbolt.info,  Node: Adding a Language,  Up: Developing

6.1 Adding a Language
=====================

Adding support for a new language is fairly easy.  The closer it is to
existing compilers, the easier it will be (to the point where a clone of
a C compiler is just a couple copy-paste lines).  However, it is not
excessively hard to add support for completely foreign compilers and
bytecode/assembly formats.

   As a minimum starting point, you must know how to compile a source
file to assembly or bytecode on the command line, and know how the line
numbers are available in the compiled form if they exist.

  1. Add a new entry to the language definitions statement.
     (../rmsbolt.el)
        • To do this, you will need to (at a minimum) add a mode,
          compile-command, a compile-cmd-function, and a starter file
          name.
        • The compile-cmd-function is a function that will turn local
          variable settings into a valid command which will take in a
          filename and output assembly or an executable.  See
          ‘rmsbolt--c-compile-cmd’ for an example.
        • When building compilation commands, please make sure to use
          absolute paths, as the default-directory is not guaranteed to
          be stable.
        • If the assembly is not in a standard format, you will need to
          define a ‘process-asm-custom-fn’ as well (see python/java for
          examples).
        • If you would like to add language tweaks in your own config
          (ie: take full control over what rmsbolt does completely), you
          can use ‘rmsbolt-language-descriptor’ to fully override the
          defaults with a custom language definition.
  2. Add a new entry into the starter file (../rmsbolt.el)
        • For this, you will need to make a starter file.  See this
          folder (./../starters/) for existing examples.
        • Ideally, try to pick something which is interesting to play
          with from an disassembly point of view.

   You’re done!
