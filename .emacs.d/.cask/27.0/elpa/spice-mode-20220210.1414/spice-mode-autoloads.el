Major mode for editing spice decks in (X)Emacs.

Entry to Spice mode calls the value of the variable `spice-mode-hook'
with no args, if that value is non-nil after initialization is finished.

Usage & Features:
-----------------

   - Comprehensive menu

   - Highlighting of (extended) SPICE syntax, with (limited) ERROR notification
     Please setup spice-mode to recognize the correct syntax through
     customization of the `spice-standard' variable. You can use the menu
     entry Spice->Customize->Spice Standard to do this interactively.

   - Template insertion (abbrev/electrification) for many spice constructs,
     two alternatives are available: Abbrev minor mode and `tempo-complete-tag'
       + Abbrevs can be turned on and off via the Settings submenu.
         To see the available abbrevs, use `M-x list-abbrevs' or use the menu
         after enabling abbrev minor mode. To find out what key sequence
         triggers an expand do 'C-h w expand-abbrev'.
       + `tempo-complete-tag' is bound to <tab> - for example, type 'M<tab>'
         at the beginning of a line and you will be prompted with a complete
         Mosfet template. Most tags are pretty straightforward i.e 'C' for a
         capacitor, 'L' for an inductance etc...
         You can type `C-h v tempo-tags'for a complete list of tags and
         associated templates. Note: to insert a real <TAB>, use <C-q TAB> or
         <shift TAB>.

   - Comment & documentation string handling
       + the '*' symbol is used to comment out a whole line - that symbol has
         to be at the beginning of a line
       + the '!' and '$' symbols are used to document your netlist in eldo
         and hspice/layla mode respectively
       + menu entry to comment out region/uncomment region
       + key bindings for commenting/uncommenting a region as in `auctex-mode'.

   - Comment hiding support
       + Can hide all commented out regions in a buffer to improve readability
       + prefix string is customizable: `spice-hide-line-prefix'.
       + custom variable can be set to automatically hide all commented regions
         at load time (`spice-auto-hide-comments')
       + requires use of doc strings, otherwise also documentation might be
         hidden
       + When parts of the deck are hidden the string \"H+\" appears in the
         modeline.

   - Imenu (Index menu and/or shift right click in emacs if configured)
       + shows subcircuit definitions
       + shows .end statements in submenu
       + shows device models in submenus
       + shows libraries (.lib/.inc) in submenu
       + shows analyses in submenu
       + shows sections in submenu
       + shows output file sections in menu
       + shows LAYLA objects in submenus if layla submode has been enabled
       + can be added to the menubar by setting `spice-imenu-add-to-menubar'
         (uses `imenu-add-to-menubar' to add an Imenu entry to the menubar).

   - File browser using Speedbar (`speedbar') and/or index/sources menu

   - .inc/.include/.lib/.libfas access
       + through mouse-2 click (`ffap-at-mouse' or `spice-load-file-at-mouse')
       + using \\r (ie. <return>), (`ffap')
       + through menu entry all include/lib files of a deck can be loaded at
         once (`spice-load-include-files'), recursively.

   - Searching for .subckt defs: `spice-search-subckt' or `C-c C-s'
       + extracts subcircuit name from context
       + search history
       + mark is set where search has been started if the definition is found
         in the same file. Return to mark with `C-u C-<SPC>' (or `C-u C-@')
         as with interactive searches (fi `isearch-forward')
       + be careful when starting the search from an included file,
         correctness can not be guaranteed. Starting a search from
         a top-level .cir file gives correct results. The latest used
         top-level file is stored (a top-level file contains a .end
         statement !), and also searched if the subckt def is not found in
         a first pass (for instance when starting from an included file).

   - Postscript printing with fontification (through `ps-print' package).

   - Addition of Spice Deck submenu in msb mode, see `msb', `spice-msb-fix'.

   - Section support (as in eldo-mode):
       + add section headers, goto section through menu entries or interactive
       + customizable through `spice-section-alist', you can add your
         own section headers, alter the list of predefined sections, ...
       + Changelog addition through `spice-add-changelog-entry', or
         use `C-c a c'.

   - Simulator support
       + use `spice-simulator' and `spice-simulator-switches' to
         select your simulator from `spice-simulator-alist'.
       + Support for error parsing of spice3 (batch-mode, -b),
         hspice, eldo and spectre. Add your own in spice-mode or through
         customization in `.emacs'.
       + use local file variables to customize per file as follows:
<<< test.cir >>>
.op
.end

* Local Variables:
* mode: spice
* spice-simulator: \"Hspice\"
* spice-simulator-switches: \"\"
* eval: (spice-set-command)
* End:
<<< test.cir ends here >>>

   - Waveform viewer support (beta)
       + use `spice-waveform-viewer' and `spice-waveform-viewer-switches' to
         select your waveform from `spice-waveform-viewer-alist'.
       + Support for interactive (command-line) waveform viewer such as
         nutmeg, or batch (GUI) type waveform viewer such as xelga or gsi.

   - Output file support
       + can load output file from menu (checks if file exists and is readable)
       + imenu in output files shows output file sections
       + for eldo .chi files: can create <file>_guess.cir files automatically
         for inclusion in <file>.cir file through
         `spice-create-guess-nodeset-file'
         or `spice-replace-with-guess-nodeset-statements'; this speeds up DC
         convergence for AC analyses.

   - (Fully) customizable
       + can select spice compatibility mode:
          * spice2g6/3 (default)
          * hspice (default)
          * eldo (default), RF and verilog-A extensions
          * fasthenry (default)
          * Dracula CDL
          * LAYLA, Mondriaan extensions
          * any combination of the above (there are conflicts however, so not
            all keyword fontification is correct in the latter case)
       + spice-mode font-lock faces
       + spice-mode default initialization of empty/new files determined by
         `spice-initialize-empty-file', `spice-initialize-template-file',
         `spice-default-header' and `spice-initialize-file-function'.
       + see the customization examples in the `spice-mode.el' file header
       + You can adapt `spice-simulator-alist' for your local site in
         `spice-mode.el' or in `.emacs' through customization.
       + You can adapt `spice-waveform-viewer-alist' for your local site in
         `spice-mode.el' or in `.emacs' through customization.
       + You can adapt `spice-section-alist' for your local site in
         `spice-mode.el' or in `.emacs' through customization.

   - Auto fill minor mode support
       + can be turned on from the Settings menu
       + auto fill works both for element where the continuation character
         is a '+', as well as in comment/doc mode where the continuation
         character is a '*', '$' or a '!'.
       + uses `fill-column' to determine where to wrap the line
       + doesn't use `fill-prefix'. A context dependent prefix is calculated
         through the `spice-comment-indent-new-line' function. This function
         is used as `comment-line-break-function' instead of the default line
         break function (in emacs: `comment-indent-new-line').

   - Paragraph support: [a-z] starts dev lines, '+' continues dev lines,
     [*!$] start paragraphs.

   - Works under GNU Emacs20.6/21.[123].


Do not use a -*- Mode -*- line in a spice deck as the first card in
the deck is defined to be the title card. Rather, autoload spice-mode
through your .emacs file:

 (autoload 'spice-mode \"spice-mode\" \"Spice/Layla Editing Mode\" t)
 (setq auto-mode-alist (append (list (cons \"\\\\.sp$\"  'spice-mode)
 				     (cons \"\\\\.cir$\" 'spice-mode)
 				     (cons \"\\\\.cdl$\" 'spice-mode)
 				     (cons \"\\\\.chi$\" 'spice-mode) ; output
 				     (cons \"\\\\.mod$\" 'spice-mode)); models
 			       auto-mode-alist))

Alternative methods are provided in the spice-mode.el file header.
