enable the mode if ARG is omitted or NIL, and toggle it if ARG is
`toggle'.

This minor mode sets hooks so when you `find-file' it calls
`vimish-fold--restore-folds' and when you kill a file it calls
`vimish-fold--save-folds'.

For globalized version of this mode see `vimish-gold-global-mode'.

either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `vimish-fold-global-mode'.")
