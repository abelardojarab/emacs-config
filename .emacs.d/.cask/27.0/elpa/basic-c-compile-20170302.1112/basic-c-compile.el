;; Version: 1.5.9
;; Package-Version: 20170302.1112
;; Keywords: C, Makefile, compilation, convenience
;; URL: https://github.com/nick96/basic-c-compile
;; Package-Requires: ((cl-lib "0.5") (f "0.19.0"))

;;; Commentary:

;; basic-c-compile aims to augment your C programming workflow.  It
;; provides commands to create a Makefile, compile file(s) and run
;; file(s).  The specifics of many of these commands can be changed
;; using the customisable variables for this package.  They are all
;; described in README.org.
;;
;; Basic setup:
;; Add (require 'basic-c-compile) to you init file.

;;; Bugs:
;; Compilation hangs if basic-c-compile-run-c is called and it find
;; that the outfile is out of date.  Press enter to get passed this.

;;; TODO:
;; Refactor to utilise s, f and dash libraries -- makes code cleaner
;; Remove rebuild in Makefile -- Make does this for us

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'f)

;; User customisation
;; These can be changed by the user in their init file
;; or using the customisation menu.
