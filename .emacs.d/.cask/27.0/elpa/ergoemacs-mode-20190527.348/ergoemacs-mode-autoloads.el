A component of an ergoemacs-theme.

This macro parses BODY-AND-PLIST to Emacs code to generate an
`erogemacs-mode' theme component.

This accepts the following keywords:

:bind -- What keys to bind.  This is compatible with use-package
    definitions.  That is it can take a command like:

    :bind (\"C-.\" . ace-jump-mode)

    or list of commands

    :bind ((\"M-o l\" . highlight-lines-matching-regexp)
           (\"M-o r\" . highlight-regexp)
           (\"M-o w\" . highlight-phrase))

    This list of commands can just be a list without the extra
    parentheses for each command:

    :bind (\"M-o l\" . highlight-lines-matching-regexp
           \"M-o r\" . highlight-regexp
           \"M-o w\" . highlight-phrase)


    Note that these keys may change based on keyboard layouts,
    and also these keys can accept special ergoemacs-commands and
    keymaps (unlike use-package).

    When package-name is non-nil, create autoloads for undefined commands.

    Default: nil

:bind-keymap -- A keymap to bind.  Similar to :bind but used for
    keymaps.  This is processed before :bind keywords.  While
    this is necessary for use-package, it is not necessary for
    `ergoemacs-mode'.  However, this keyword is provided for convenience. 

    Default: nil

:bind* -- Keys to bind above minor modes (in
  `ergoemacs-override-keymap').

   Default: nil

:bind-keymap* -- Keymap to bind above minor modes (in
   `ergoemacs-override-keymap').

    Default: nil

:commands -- List of commands to create autoloads for.  This can
    take a command like:

    :commands ace-jump-mode

    Or

    :commands (isearch-moccur isearch-all)

    When :package-name is non-nil, this will create autoloads for
    the commands.

:defer -- Should this package's loading be deferred?
    When using :commands :bind :bind* :bind-keymap :bind-keymap*
   :mode or :interperter, defer is implied.  When :package-name
   is nil, this dosen't do anything.

:demand -- Prevent deferred loading in all cases

:diminish -- Diminish this mode.  It can be of the following forms:

    :diminish t -- Assumes that :package-name is diminshed
    :diminish package-name -- Diminshes package-name
    :diminish (package-name \" New Description\")
    :diminish (package-name \" unicode\" \" str\")

    For more information, see `ergoemacs-component--diminish-on'.

    By default this is nil.

:mode -- Modes to be added to `auto-mode-alist'. This can be a string such as:

\(ergoemacs-package ruby-mode
    :mode \"\\\\.rb\\\\'\")

or a list 

\(ergoemacs-package ruby-mode
    :mode (\"\\\\.rb\\\\'\" . ruby-mode))

or a list of modes:

\(ergoemacs-package ess-site
    :ensure ess
    :mode ((\"\\\\.R\\\\'\" . R.mode)
           (\"\\\\.[Ss][Aa][Ss]\\\\'\" . SAS-mode)))

Borrowed from `use-package'.

:ensure -- If the package should be installed by `package' if not present.

This can be t to install the :package-name symbol.  Otherwise
it can be a list of symbols or single symbol.

:package-name -- Name of package to load.  When non-nil any key
defition to a single command will create an autoload for that
command.

Default: nil

:no-load / :no-require -- Don't load/require the package-name.

:ergoemacs-require -- when non-nil, this ergoemacs-component is
required with `ergoemacs-require'. By default this is disabled

:just-first-keys -- Keys where a fixed amount of the key is based
on variable keyboard placement, then the rest of the key is
based on letter.  For example with the apps component, the
just first keys are defined to be [apps ?h], which means the
\[apps h] will be defined based on finger placement, but the
keys afterward would be based on letter.

By default this is defined as nil, meaning no special keys
like this occur.

:just-first-keys (list [apps ?h] [menu ?h])
Defaults to nil

:variable-modifiers -- Modifiers that are considierd variable.
These modifiers have keys change among various keyboard
layouts.  That is keys are bound based on finger placement
among various keyboard layouts.

Defaults to '(meta)

:variable-prefixes -- Keyboard prefixes that are considiered
variable.  After these keys are pressed, the keyboard layout
dictates the keys.  That is, keys are bound based on finger
placement among various keyboard layouts.

Defaults to '([apps] [menu] [27])

:layout -- Layout that the key bindings are based on.

Defaults to us (QWERTY)

Please do not use the following tags, since they are parsed based
on the definition:

:name -- Component Name

:description -- Component Description

:file -- File where the component was defined.

properties to be changed, even in a read-only buffer.

This macro should be placed around all calculations which set

deleting it again), so that the user never sees them on his
