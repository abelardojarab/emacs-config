;;; Commentary:

;; The `auto-dim-other-buffers-mode' is a global minor mode which
;; makes non-current buffer less prominent making it more apparent
;; which window has a focus.

;; The preferred way to install the mode is by installing a package
;; form MELPA:
;;
;;     M-x package-install RET auto-dim-other-buffers RET

;; Once installed, the mode can be turned on (globally) with:
;;
;;     M-x auto-dim-other-buffers-mode RET

;; To make the mode enabled every time Emacs starts, add the following
;; to Emacs initialisation file (~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el):
;;
;;     (add-hook 'after-init-hook (lambda ()
;;       (when (fboundp 'auto-dim-other-buffers-mode)
;;         (auto-dim-other-buffers-mode t))))

;; To configure how dimmed buffers look like, customise
;; `auto-dim-other-buffers-face'.  This can be accomplished by:
;;
;;     M-x customize-face RET auto-dim-other-buffers-face RET
