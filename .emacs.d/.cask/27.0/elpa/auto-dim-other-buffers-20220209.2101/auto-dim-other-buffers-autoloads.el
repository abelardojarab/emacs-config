Visually makes windows without focus less prominent.

If called interactively, enable Auto-Dim-Other-Buffers mode if
ARG is positive, and disable it if ARG is zero or negative.  If
called from Lisp, also enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil,
and toggle it if ARG is `toggle'; disable the mode otherwise.

Windows without input focus are made to look less prominent by
applying ‘auto-dim-other-buffers-face’ to them.  With many windows
in a frame, the idea is that this mode helps recognise which is
the selected window by providing a non-intrusive but still
noticeable visual indicator.

Note that despite it’s name, since Emacs 27 this mode operates
on *windows* rather than buffers.  In older versions of Emacs, if
a buffer was displayed in multiple windows, none of them would be
dimmed even though at most one could have focus.  This historic
behaviour is where the mode gets its name from.
