;;; Commentary:

;; Provides support for the :hydra keyword, which is made available by
;; default by requiring `use-package'.

;;; Code:

(require 'use-package-core)

(defun use-package-hydra--name (name)
  "Build hydra name for the package NAME."
  (cl-gentemp (concat "hydra-" (symbol-name name))))

(defun use-package-hydra--normalize (name _keyword args)
  "Normalize the ARGS to be a list hydras.
It accepts a single hydra, or a list of hydras.  It is optional
provide a name for the hydra, if so there is a name generated
from NAME."
  (let (name result*)
    (while args
      (cond
       ;; single named hydra
       ((symbolp (car args))
        (setq result* (nconc result* (list args))
              args nil))
       ;; single unnamed hydra with docstring
       ((stringp (nth 2 args))
        (setq name (use-package-hydra--name name)
              result* (nconc result* (list (cons name args)))
              args nil))
       ;; TODO single unnamed hydra without docstring

       ;; list of hydras
       ((listp (car args))
        (setq result*
              (nconc result* (use-package-hydra--normalize name _keyword (car args)))
              args (cdr args)))
       ;; Error!
