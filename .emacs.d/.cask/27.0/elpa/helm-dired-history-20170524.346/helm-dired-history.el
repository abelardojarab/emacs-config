;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Someone like to reuse the current dired buffer to visit
;; another directory, so that you just need open one dired
;; buffer. but the bad point is ,you can't  easily go
;; forward and back in different dired directory. this file
;; can remember dired directory you have visited and list them
;; using `helm.el'.

;; integrating dired history feature into commands like
;; dired-do-copy and dired-do-rename. What I think of is that when
;; user press C (copy) or R (rename) mode, it is excellent to have
;; an option allowing users to select a directory from the history
;; list.

;; after integrated the initial-input of `dired' `dired-other-window'
;; and `dired-other-frame' are changed from default-directory to empty,
;; and the first element of history is default-directory,so you can
;; just press `RET' or `C-j' to select it.



;;; Installation:

;; (require 'savehist)
;; (add-to-list 'savehist-additional-variables 'helm-dired-history-variable)
;; (savehist-mode 1)

;; (with-eval-after-load 'dired
;;   (require 'helm-dired-history)
;; ;; if you are using ido,you'd better disable ido for dired
;; ;; (define-key (cdr ido-minor-mode-map-entry) [remap dired] nil) ;in ido-setup-hook
;;   (define-key dired-mode-map "," 'dired))
;; or
;; (with-eval-after-load 'dired
;;   (require 'helm-dired-history)
;;   (define-key dired-mode-map "," 'dired))
