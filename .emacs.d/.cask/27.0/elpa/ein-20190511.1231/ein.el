;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs IPython Notebook (EIN) lets you edit and run Jupyter_ (formerly IPython)
;; notebooks within Emacs.  It channels all the power of Emacs without the
;; idiosyncrasies of in-browser editing.
;;
;; EIN was originally written by tkf_.  More `complete documentation`_ is available.

(provide 'ein)

;;; Old commentary:

;; Development
;; ===========

;; Event vs hook vs callback
;; -------------------------
;;
;; * Use events (`ein:events') for calling (possibly multiple) functions
;;   for its side effect.
;; * Use hooks for global/configurable setting.
;; * Use callback when caller needs returned value.
;;   (e.g., `:get-buffers' slot in `ein:kernelinfo')

;; Naming
;; ------
;;
;; Variable named `ein:%VAR-NAME%' is a permanent buffer local
;; variable defined by `ein:deflocal'.  It is often an instance of a
;; class/struct named `ein:VAR-NAME'.
;;
;; Old naming rule:
;; * `ein:@VAR-NAME'/`ein:VAR-NAME' is a permanent buffer local
;;   variable.  These variables are obsolete now.
;; * `ein:$STRUCT-NAME' is a name of struct.
;;   These strcuts will be renamed to `ein:CLASS-NAME' when
;;   reimplementing them using EIEIO class instead of CL struct.
;;

;; `CLiki : naming conventions <http://www.cliki.net/naming%20conventions>`_

;; Integrate ein into core emacs functionality
(when (boundp 'mouse-buffer-menu-mode-groups)
  (add-to-list 'mouse-buffer-menu-mode-groups
               '("^ein:" . "ein")))
