Create the CSS for all font definitions in the current Emacs session.
Use this to create face definitions in your CSS style file that can then
be used by code snippets transformed by htmlize.
This command just produces a buffer that contains class definitions for all
faces used in the current Emacs session.  You can copy and paste the ones you
need into your CSS file.

If you then set `org-twbs-htmlize-output-type' to `css', calls
to the function `org-twbs-htmlize-region-for-paste' will
produce code that uses these same face definitions.

Export current buffer to an HTML buffer.

If narrowing is active in the current buffer, only export its
narrowed part.

If a region is active, export that region.

A non-nil optional argument ASYNC means the process should happen
asynchronously.  The resulting buffer should be accessible
through the `org-export-stack' interface.

When optional argument SUBTREEP is non-nil, export the sub-tree
at point, extracting information from the headline properties
first.

When optional argument VISIBLE-ONLY is non-nil, don't export
contents of hidden elements.

When optional argument BODY-ONLY is non-nil, only write code
between \"<body>\" and \"</body>\" tags.

EXT-PLIST, when provided, is a property list with external
parameters overriding Org default settings, but still inferior to
file-local settings.

Export is done in a buffer named \"*Org HTML Export*\", which
