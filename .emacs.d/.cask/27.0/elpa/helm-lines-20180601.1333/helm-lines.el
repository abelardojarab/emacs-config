;;; Commentary:

;; A helm interface for completing by lines in project.
;;
;; Run `helm-lines' to complete the current line by other lines that
;; exist in the current git project.
;;
;; Enable `helm-follow-mode' to replace in place as you jump around
;; the suggestions.
;;
;; The project root is defined by the result of
;; `helm-lines-project-root-function', and by default it is the root
;; of the current version-control tree.  Projectile users might like
;; to set this variable to `projectile-root'.
;;
;; Requires `ag' [1], `pt' [2] or similar to be installed. If you prefer
;; something other than `ag' you need to customize the
;; `helm-lines-search-function' accordingly, see below.
;;
;; The lines completed against are defined by the result of the
;; `helm-lines-search-function', and by default it is `helm-lines-search-ag'.
;; Users that prefer `pt' over `ag' can set this variable to
;; `helm-lines-search-pt'. Other engines can be supported by supplying a
;; custom search function. It will be called with the shell quoted query and the
;; shell quoted folder to search in.
