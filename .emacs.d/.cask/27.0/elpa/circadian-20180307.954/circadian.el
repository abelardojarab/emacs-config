;;; Commentary:
;; Circadian provides automated theme switching based on daytime.
;;
;; Example usage (with `use-package') - make sure to properly set your
;; latitude & longitude:
;;
;; (use-package circadian
;;   :config
;;   (setq calendar-latitude 49.0)
;;   (setq calendar-longitude 8.5)
;;   (setq circadian-themes '((:sunrise . wombat)
;;                            ("8:00"   . tango)
;;                            (:sunset  . adwaita)
;;                            ("23:30"  . tango)))
