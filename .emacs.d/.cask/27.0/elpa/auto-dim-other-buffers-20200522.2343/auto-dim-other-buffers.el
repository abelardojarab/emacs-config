;;; Commentary:

;; The ‘auto-dim-other-buffers-mode’ is a global minor mode which makes windows
;; without focus less prominent.  With many windows in a frame, the idea is that
;; this mode helps recognise which is the selected window by providing
;; a non-intrusive but still noticeable visual indicator.

;; The preferred way to install the mode is by grabbing ‘auto-dim-other-buffers’
;; package form MELPA:
;;
;;     M-x package-install RET auto-dim-other-buffers RET

;; Once installed, the mode can be turned on (globally) with:
;;
;;     M-x auto-dim-other-buffers-mode RET

;; To make the mode enabled every time Emacs starts, add the following
;; to Emacs initialisation file (~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el):
;;
;;     (add-hook 'after-init-hook (lambda ()
;;       (when (fboundp 'auto-dim-other-buffers-mode)
;;         (auto-dim-other-buffers-mode t))))

;; To configure how dimmed buffers look like, customise
;; `auto-dim-other-buffers-face'.  This can be accomplished by:
;;
;;     M-x customize-face RET auto-dim-other-buffers-face RET

;; More customisation can be found in ‘auto-dim-other-buffers’ customisation
;; group which can be accessed with:
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET auto-dim-other-buffers RET

;; Note that despite it’s name, since Emacs 27 the mode operates on *windows*
;; rather than buffers.  I.e. selected window is highlighted and all other
;; windows are dimmed even if they display the same buffer.  In older Emacs
;; versions the mode falls back to the old behaviour where all windows
;; displaying selected buffer are highlighted.  This historic behaviour
;; is where the mode gets its name from.
