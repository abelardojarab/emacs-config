;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Provide Helm commands and sources for Purpose.
;; Features:
;; - helmize all Purpose commands
;; - special helm commands:
;;   + `helm-purpose-switch-buffer-with-purpose': same as `helm-buffers-list',
;;     but only list buffers with a specific purpose (default: same purpose as
;;     current buffer).
;;   + `helm-purpose-switch-buffer-with-some-purpose': choose a purpose, then
;;     call `helm-purpose-switch-buffer-with-purpose'.
;;   + `helm-purpose-mini-ignore-purpose': same as `helm-mini', but
;;     ignore Purpose when displaying the buffer.
;;
;; Setup:
;; Call `helm-purpose-setup' in your init file.  It will helmize all Purpose
;; commands, but won't change any key bindings.
;; Alternatively, you can set `purpose-preferred-prompt' to `helm' instead.
;;
;; Key Bindings:
;; `helm-purpose' doesn't bind any keys, you are free to define your own
;; bindings as you please.
