;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; This extension provides the functions of auto-complete for handling Programmable Completion.
;; You can define the source of auto-complete.el by using them for handling pcomplete.
;; For more information, see <https://github.com/aki2o/auto-complete-pcmp/blob/master/README.org>

;;; Dependency:
;; 
;; - auto-complete.el ( see <https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete> )
;; - yaxception.el ( see <https://github.com/aki2o/yaxception> )
;; - log4e.el ( see <https://github.com/aki2o/log4e> )

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put this to your load-path.
;; And put the following lines in your .emacs or site-start.el file.
;; 
;; (require 'auto-complete-pcmp)

;;; API:
;; 
;; [EVAL] (autodoc-document-lisp-buffer :type 'command :prefix "ac-pcmp/" :docstring t)
;; `ac-pcmp/self-insert-command-with-ac-start'
;; Do `self-insert-command' and `auto-complete'.
;; 
;;  *** END auto-documentation
;; [EVAL] (autodoc-document-lisp-buffer :type 'function :prefix "ac-pcmp/" :docstring t)
;; `ac-pcmp/get-ac-candidates'
;; Return the result of `pcomplete'.
;; `ac-pcmp/do-ac-action'
;; Do the same action that `pcomplete' does after completion.
;; 
;;  *** END auto-documentation
;; [Note] Functions and variables other than listed above, Those specifications may be changed without notice.

;;; Tested On:
