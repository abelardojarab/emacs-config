Export current buffer to a text buffer by delegation.

Delegating: ASYNC, SUTREEP, and EXT-PLIST.

If narrowing is active in the current buffer, only export its
narrowed part.

If a region is active, export that region.

A non-nil optional argument ASYNC means the process should happen
asynchronously.  The resulting buffer should be accessible
through the `org-export-stack' interface.

When optional argument SUBTREEP is non-nil, export the sub-tree
at point, extracting information from the headline properties

display a buffer with the export value.

org2blog/wp operates using the following APIs in the order
listed below, followed by details about their debug output:

- org2blog: Application Layer
  - ox-wp: WordPress API
    - Display export in a text buffer: *Org WordPress Export*
- xml-rpc: Message processing layer
  - The XML message content sent to the server over HTTPS.
    Useful for testing with cURL and comparing the results
    to xml-rpc.
    - View call request data in buffer: request-data
  - The internal data structure used to make the
    post call. Useful for a quick view of the call details
    as an Elisp list.
    - View xml-rpc method call data in buffer: func-call
- url-util: Message transfer layer
  - Debug messages output in buffer: *URL-DEBUG*
- gnutls: Secure communications layer
  - Debug messages output in buffer: *Messages*

Investigate by going through layer's messages from top to bottom.
Call function ‘org2blog-version-info’ to display runtime version numbers

You usually only need to keep track of what is happening between
two of them because if it is doing what you expect then you
can move on.

Consider print messages where you need them and also using Edebug.
With virtually no setup Edebug lets you walk through a function
and evaluate local variables to see precisely what is happening.

If after studying the request body, messages, and control flow
things still don't work then the best thing to do is to test the
call using another tool. Paste the request-data into a file named
`test.txt' and make the request using cURL like this:

curl --data @test.txt https://www.yourblog.com/xmlrpc.php

By this point you'll have a better sense of where things are
happening, or not, and now might be the time to move on to the
transfer layer.

If you are investigating at the GnuTLS layer it helps to study
the debug messages side by side with the output of an analysis
tool like tcpdump or Wireshark. Viewing them side-by-side helps
to make better sense of the flow and interactions between what
you expected, the APIs tried to do, and what really happened
over the wire. If the time comes to dig deeper into the
communications layer then start by reading more in the variable
‘gnutls-algorithm-priority’ and it's referenced GnuTLS
documentation. GnuTLS doesn’t expose a version number as a
variable, but you will see it in the detailed logging
messages.

This is beyond the domains of Emacs and into GnuTLS. However,
it will let you do things like selectively enable and disable
protocols to help narrow down what works and what doesn't, helping
you further investigate the issue. The contents of the debug
buffer include things like certificate version and issuer, public
key algorithm, and protocol. The protocol information is particularly
important because when clients connect to a server the protocol
is often negotiated and it might not be what you expect. For
example this is why your XML request might work using cURL
but not using gnutls: the negotiated protocol version might not quite work
right between your client and the server! A solution here then is to
force a different method by customizing ‘gnutls-algorithm-priority’.
If you get this far, then give yourself a pat on the back for digging
deeper. It is actually pretty fun to look behind the curtain and what
is happening on the socket layer. Of course that is only looking
back at it—at the time it is pretty unpleasant!

Tracking down the unexpected behavior requires no magic–just
patience and persistence and definitely talking it through
with others. Before getting overwhelmed, take a break and
consider reaching out using email or an Issue Request.

Remember: Org2Blog is trying to keep the fun in blogging. So
enjoy working through your debugging session, it is one step
closer to doing more blogging!
