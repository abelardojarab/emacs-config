  "A list of format strings used to insert citations into text buffers.
Each item in this option consists of a major mode and a list of
identifier + format strings pairs.  The identifiers (which can be
any string) are used to select the citation command in
`ebib-insert-citation' and `ebib-push-citation'.  The format
strings are used to construct the citation command that is
inserted in the buffer.

The major mode can also be specified as `any', which defines
citation commands that are available in buffers that do not have
any of the major modes listed in this option.  By default, this
is used for LaTeX citations, so as to cover all TeX and LaTeX
modes.

The format string template can contain a number of formatting
directives:

%K: the key of the entry.
%A: an argument; prompts the user.
%D: a description; prompts the user.
%<...%>: optional material surrounding %A.
%(...%): a repeater, which must contain %K.

%A is used for arguments to the citation command, which are
elements such as page numbers, etc.  %A accommodates optional
arguments in LaTeX-based citations and, similarly, optional
material in Pandoc Markdown citations.  %D can be used to provide
a description as used in Org-mode links.  The user is prompted
for this description, but if possible a default is provided,
which can be accepted by hitting RET.

Optional material around %A is only included if the user provides
some string for %A.  If not, the optional material is omitted.

The command `ebib-push-citation' can be used on multiple
entries (by marking them in the index buffer).  If the template
contains a repeater, the material inside this repeater is
processed for each key individually.  If there is no repeater,
all keys are substituted for %K using a separator for which the
user is prompted.

The repeater can optionally contain a separator, which must be
placed between % and ); to use comma as a separator, the format
shring should contain \"%(%K%,)\".  If the separator is not
provided, the user is prompted to supply one."
