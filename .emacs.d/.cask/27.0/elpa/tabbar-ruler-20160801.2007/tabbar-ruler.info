1.1 Introduction
================

Tabbar ruler is an emacs package that allows both the tabbar and the
ruler to be used together. In addition it allows auto-hiding of the
menu-bar and tool-bar.

Tabbar appearance based on reverse engineering Aquaemacs code and
changing to my preferences, and Emacs Wiki.

Tabbar/Ruler integration is new. Tabbar should be active on mouse move.
Ruler should be active on self-insert commands.

Also allows auto-hiding of toolbar and menu.

To use this, put the library in your load path and use

(setq tabbar-ruler-global-tabbar t) ; If you want tabbar (setq
tabbar-ruler-global-ruler t) ; if you want a global ruler (setq
tabbar-ruler-popup-menu t) ; If you want a popup menu. (setq
tabbar-ruler-popup-toolbar t) ; If you want a popup toolbar (setq
tabbar-ruler-popup-scrollbar t) ; If you want to only show the ; scroll
bar when your mouse is moving. (require 'tabbar-ruler)

1.2 Changing how tabbar groups files/buffers
============================================

The default behavior for tabbar-ruler is to group the tabs by frame.
You can change this back to the old-behavior by:

(tabbar-ruler-group-buffer-groups)

or by issuing the following code:

(setq tabbar-buffer-groups-function 'tabbar-buffer-groups)

In addition, you can also group by projectile project easily by:

(tabbar-ruler-group-by-projectile-project)

1.3 Adding key-bindings to tabbar-ruler
=======================================

You can add key-bindings to change the current tab. The easiest way to
add the bindings is to add a key like:

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c t") 'tabbar-ruler-move)

After that, all you would need to press is Control+c t and then the
arrow keys will allow you to change the buffer quite easily. To exit
the buffer movement you can press enter or space.

1.4 Known issues

the left arrow is text instead of an image. ## History

org-readme issue (Matthew L. Fidler) - *28-Jun-2013* - Added popup
scrollbarbar (Matthew L. Fidler) - *27-Jun-2013* - Added autoload for

Matthew L. Fidler Last-Updated: Sat Dec 15 15:44:34 2012 (+0800) #663
(Matthew L. Fidler) Added left-char and right char to
tabbar-ruler-move-keymap so that keybindings in emacs 24.3 work
correctly. 6-Jun-2013 Matthew L. Fidler Last-Updated: Sat Dec 15
15:44:34 2012 (+0800) #663 (Matthew L. Fidler) Changed movement
commands. The movement commands are simpler (in my opinion) 4-Jun-2013
Matthew L. Fidler Last-Updated: Sat Dec 15 15:44:34 2012 (+0800) #663
(Matthew L. Fidler) Change package description. Fixed the documentation
to actually change to the old tabbar method of grouping buffers.
4-Jun-2013 Matthew L. Fidler Last-Updated: Sat Dec 15 15:44:34 2012
(+0800) #663 (Matthew L. Fidler) Turn off ruler mode in the next buffer
(if necessary) 4-Jun-2013 Matthew L. Fidler Last-Updated: Sat Dec 15
15:44:34 2012 (+0800) #663 (Matthew L. Fidler) Add movement keys. Also
add toggles for different groupings. 1-May-2013 Matthew L. Fidler
Last-Updated: Sat Dec 15 15:44:34 2012 (+0800) #663 (Matthew L. Fidler)
Try to address issue #4 1-May-2013 Matthew L. Fidler Last-Updated: Sat
Dec 15 15:44:34 2012 (+0800) #663 (Matthew L. Fidler) Changed the
modified font to italics. Made the modified symbol customizable, but
off by default. Should address issue #5. 5-Apr-2013 Matthew L. Fidler
Last-Updated: Sat Dec 15 15:44:34 2012 (+0800) #663 (Matthew L. Fidler)
Trying to update upstream sources. 5-Apr-2013 Matthew L. Fidler
Last-Updated: Sat Dec 15 15:44:34 2012 (+0800) #663 (Matthew L. Fidler)
Fixed speed issues on windows. It wasn't a redraw that was causing the
speed issues, it was the constant recreation of the right-click
menus... (Matthew L. Fidler) - *27-Mar-2013* - Fixed typo to fix issue
#2. (Matthew L. Fidler) - *27-Mar-2013* - Attempt to fix issue #2.
Whenever the color is not a string, assume that it should be
transparent. I'm unsure if the mac osx puts the translated color to a
string. However, it seems that the undefined should be the same as
transparent. Therefore, this fix *should* work... (Matthew L. Fidler) -
*20-Mar-2013* - Add inverse video option for unselected tabbar. Made it
the default. has better contrast between the selected and unselected
tabs. (Matthew L. Fidler) - *20-Mar-2013* - Changed emacs 24.3 to
support the times character. Also removed starred documentation
strings. (Matthew L. Fidler) - *20-Mar-2013* - Emacs 24.3 had an error
when using ucs-insert. Added fallbacks so that this works when
ucs-insert does not work. (Matthew L. Fidler) - *20-Feb-2013* - Changed
so that the separators do not need to be fancy images. I found that
when the separators were images, it slowed down emacs on windows.
Therefore, the fancy images are disabled by default. This also includes
the stylized close symbols. (Matthew L. Fidler) - *19-Dec-2012* - Added
back popup-menu (Matthew L. Fidler) - *19-Dec-2012* - Upload to
marmalade (Matthew L. Fidler) - *19-Dec-2012* - Changed slope. Made the
background color the default background color if unspecified. Made
tabbar-hex-color return "None" if not defined (Matthew L. Fidler) -
*15-Dec-2012* - Made sure that the tabbr-ruler-separator-image is at
least 17 pixels high (Matthew L. Fidler) - *15-Dec-2012* - Attempt to
fix another bug on load (Matthew L. Fidler) - *14-Dec-2012* - Fixed
tabbar ruler so that it loads cold. (Matthew L. Fidler) - *14-Dec-2012*
- Memoized the tabbar images to speed things up (Matthew L. Fidler) -
*14-Dec-2012* - Upload to Marmalade (Mat"thew L. Fidler) -
*14-Dec-2012* - Fancy tabs (Matthew L. Fidler) - *13-Dec-2012* - Added
Bug fix for coloring. Made the selected tab match the default color in
the buffer. Everything else is grayed out. (Matthew L. Fidler) -
*10-Dec-2012* - Took out a statement that may fix the left-scrolling
bug? (Matthew L. Fidler) - *10-Dec-2012* - Added package-menu-mode to
the excluded tabbar-ruler fight modes. (Matthew L. Fidler) -
*07-Dec-2012* - Will no longer take over editing of org source blocks
or info blocks. (Matthew L. Fidler) - *07-Dec-2012* - Changed the order
of checking so that helm will work when you move a mouse. (Matthew L.
Fidler) - *07-Dec-2012* - Now works with Helm. Should fix issue #1
(Matthew L. Fidler) - *06-Dec-2012* - Now colors are based on loaded
theme (from minibar). Also added bug-fix for setting tabbar colors
every time a frame opens. Also added a bug fix for right-clicking a
frame that is not associated with a buffer. 1-Mar-2012 Matthew L.
Fidler Last-Updated: Thu Mar 1 08:38:09 2012 (-0600) #656 (Matthew L.
Fidler) Will not change tool-bar-mode in Mac. It causes some funny
things to happen. 9-Feb-2012 Matthew L. Fidler Last-Updated: Thu Feb 9
19:18:21 2012 (-0600) #651 (Matthew L. Fidler) Will not change the menu
bar in a Mac. Its always there. (Matthew L. Fidler) - *14-Jan-2012* -
Added more commands that trigger the ruler. (Matthew L. Fidler) -
*14-Jan-2012* - Added more ruler commands. It works a bit better now.
Additionally I have changed the ep- to tabbar-ruler-. (Matthew L.
Fidler) - *14-Jan-2012* - Changed EmacsPortable to tabbar-ruler
(Matthew L. Fidler) - *08-Feb-2011* - Added ELPA tags. (Matthew L.
Fidler) - *08-Feb-2011* - Removed xpm dependencies. Now no images are
required, they are built by the library. (Matthew L. Fidler) -
*04-Dec-2010* - Added context menu. (Matthew L. Fidler) - *01-Dec-2010*
- Added scratch buffers to list. (Matthew L. Fidler) - *04-Nov-2010* -
Made tabbar mode default. (us041375) - *02-Nov-2010* - Make
post-command-hook handle errors gracefully. (Matthew L. Fidler) -
*20-Oct-2010* - Changed behavior when outside the window to assume the
last known mouse position. This fixes the two problems below.
(us041375) - *20-Oct-2010* - As it turns out when the toolbar is hidden
when the mouse is outside of the emacs window, it also hides when
navigating the menu. Switching behavior back. (us041375) -
*20-Oct-2010* - Made popup menu and toolbar be hidden when mouse is
oustide of emacs window. (us041375) - *20-Oct-2010* - Changed to popup
ruler-mode if tabbar and ruler are not displayed. (us041375) -
*19-Oct-2010* - Changed tabbar, menu, toolbar and ruler variables to be
buffer or frame local. (Matthew L. Fidler)
