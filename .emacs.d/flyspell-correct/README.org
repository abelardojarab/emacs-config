Correcting words with flyspell via custom interface.

[[http://d12frosted.github.io/posts/flyspell-correct-intro.html][Read intro post]]

This package provides functionality for correcting words via custom interfaces.
There are two functions for this: ~flyspell-correct-word-generic~ to correct
word at point and ~flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic~ to correct any
visible word before point. In most cases second function is more convenient, so
don't forget to bind it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key flyspell-mode-map (kbd "C-;") #'flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic)
#+END_SRC

When invoked, it will show the list of corrections suggested by Flyspell. Most
interfaces also allow you to save new word to your dictionary, accept this
spelling in current buffer or for a whole session.

Since this package does not provide any interface for correcting words, it's
better to use one of the following packages: ~flyspell-correct-ivy~,
~flyspell-correct-helm~ and ~flyspell-correct-popup~. The all depend on
~flyspell-correct~ and just provide interface for it's functionality.

* Available interfaces

Currently there are three packages that provide interface for ~flyspell-correct~:

- ~flyspell-correct-ivy~
- ~flyspell-correct-helm~
- ~flyspell-correct-popup~

In most cases you should just use one of these packages instead of interfaceless
~flyspell-correct~.

* Custom interfaces

One can easily implement custom interface for ~flyspell-correct-word-generic~ and
~flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic~. It has to be function that takes two
arguments - candidates and misspelled word. It has to return either replacement
word or ~(command, word)~ tuple that will be passed to ~flyspell-do-correct~. Check
~flyspell-correct-popup~ for example of interface that uses this feature.

* Auto correction mode

This package also provides auto correction minor mode called
=flyspell-correct-auto-mode=. When enabled it will automatically invoke
=flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic= after certain delay configured by
=flyspell-correct-auto-delay= when there is at least one misspelled word.

#+BEGIN_SRC
(add-hook 'flyspell-mode-hook #'flyspell-correct-auto-mode)
#+END_SRC

One can also configure interface specially for
=flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic= called by =flyspell-correct-auto-mode= by
setting value of =flyspell-correct-auto-mode-interface=.

* Reasoning

There are already packages like ~helm-flyspell~ and ~flyspell-popup~. So why would
anyone create yet another similar package? The reason is simple - to support
another interface or completion system. ~flyspell-correct~ started because ~ivy~ was
missing similar to ~helm-flyspell~ package. But I didn't want to create a package
just for ~ivy~. The reasoning is simple - all those packages should have similar
functionality but different interface. Adding something new to one if these
packages ideally should be reflected in all others. So I decided to create
generic package that works with any interfaces. It's not about one package
containing all possible interfaces, but about package that gives you
functionality with interface of your choice.
