# fold-this.el

Just fold the active region, please.

## How it works

The command `fold-this` visually replaces the current region with `...`.
If you move point into the ellipsis and press enter or `C-g` it is unfolded.

You can unfold everything with `fold-this-unfold-all`.

You can fold all instances of the text in the region with `fold-this-all`.

## Installation

It is available on [marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) and [Melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/):

    M-x package-install fold-this

Or just dump it in your load path somewhere and `(require 'fold-this)`

## Setup

I won't presume to know which keys you want these functions bound to,
so you'll have to set that up for yourself. Here's some example code,
which incidentally is what I use:

```cl
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-f") 'fold-this-all)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-F") 'fold-this)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c M-f") 'fold-this-unfold-all)
```

If you want to make sure that a mistype doesn't fold anything when
your region is deactivated, you can use `fold-active-region` and
`fold-active-region-all` instead.

You can customize the visuals of the folded region by changing
`fold-this-overlay` face.
