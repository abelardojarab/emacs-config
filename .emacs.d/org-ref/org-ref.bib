  abstract =	 "Abstract We performed a series of density functional theory
                  calculations of dissociative oxygen adsorption on fcc metals
                  and their corresponding rocksalt monoxides to elucidate the
                  relationship between the oxide electronic structure and its
                  corresponding reactivity. We decomposed the dissociative
                  adsorption energy of oxygen on an oxide surface into a sum of
                  the adsorption energy on the metal and a change in adsorption
                  energy caused by both expanding and oxidizing the lattice. We
                  were able to identify the key features of the electronic
                  structure that explains the trends in adsorption energies on
                  3d transition metal monoxide surfaces. ",
