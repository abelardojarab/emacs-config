                  and we analyze trends in segregation, adsorption, and surface

                  energies on the various alloy surface configurations,
                  including binding that is stronger than on a Pd(111) surface
                  and weaker than that on a Ag(111) surface. This and the
                  consideration of even small amounts of nonstoichiometries in
                  the ordered bulk alloy are found to be crucial to accurately
                  model the Pd surface segregation occurring in increasingly
