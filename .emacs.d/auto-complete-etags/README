A source for auto-complete-mode, using etags as a source.


Add the following to your emacs setting file such as .emacs:
========================================
(require 'auto-complete-etags)
(add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-etags)

;; If you want this to show documentation, also add the following:
(setq ac-etags-use-document t)
========================================

However, for now, it only supports c-mode for
showing-documentation purposes. Completing functionality is available
possibly in any modes.

Of course, you have to visit TAGS file created by etags program.  To
visit TAGS file, use M-x visit-tags-table.  Or if you want to choose
another tag file rather than that currently in use, use M-x
select-tags-table.


Here's part of my settings:
========================================
;;; function to be called when entering c-mode.
(defun my-c-mode-common-hook-func ()
  (interactive)
  "Function to be called when entering into c-mode."
  (when (and (require 'auto-complete nil t) (require 'auto-complete-config nil t))
    (auto-complete-mode t)
    (make-local-variable 'ac-sources)
    (setq ac-auto-start 2)
    (setq ac-sources '(ac-source-words-in-same-mode-buffers
                       ac-source-dictionary))
    (when (require 'auto-complete-etags nil t)
      (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-etags)
      (setq ac-etags-use-document t))))

(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-common-hook-func)
========================================
