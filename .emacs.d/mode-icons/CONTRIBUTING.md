Contributions to mode-icons are always welcomed and appreciated. To
help accept your contributions into mode-icons please consider the
following guidelines before sending a pull request.

For code:

- Use only spaces for indentation, don't use tabs.
- Try not to exceed a length of 80 characters on a single line.
  Definitely don't exceed a length of 100 characters.
- Update the CHANGELOG.md file when you add, change, fix or delete
  something users of mode-icons might notice.

For commits:

- Please keep your commits focused on a single topic. Don't fix a bug
  and include a new icon in a single commit, for example.

Feel free to discuss these guidelines with me, but I won't promise
I'll change them.

If you find any code that doesn't adhere to these guidelines, please
feel free to open a pull request with changes that fix it.
