  function.

  (both active and inactive, for major and minor modes)

  the mode-line and in other buffers, like ibuffer.

    at this variable will pick up the icon.
  - This can be customized by the variable
    `mode-icons-change-mode-name`.
  - This should be modified for packages like `powerline` and
    `smart-mode-line`.

  images.
