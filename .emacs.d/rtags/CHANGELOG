2.21
=========================

- Don't enable diagnostics automatically in `ac-init`
- Don't include private members on code completion, if not appropriate
- Fix warnings
- rtags can now installed to a tramp location
- Fix `rtags-find-file` for tramp locations.

2.20
=========================

- Diagnostics from completions can be enabled with
  --completion-diagnostics. It seems quite fast but may have
  bugs. We'll keep working on it.
- A nasty bug with our file system watcher and inotify would cause us
  to stop getting modifications from compile_commands.json. This has
  been an absolute thorn in RTags' side for years. I'm extremely
  pleased to finally have found this bug. This very severely
  impacted my personal rtags experience and likely has for lots of
  other people as well.
- Fix a weird edge-case bug when running rdm with --no-realpath and
  re-running without this switch (and vice-verse)

2.19
=========================

- Seemingly improved performance for completions due to better
  handling of unsaved files. Apparently stdin and processes in emacs
  are not our friends. Tempfiles on the other hand seem to be
  significantly faster.
- Make skipped ranges work again.
- Add a new feature, rtags-find-dead-functions (Issue #1152)
- Various contributions that improve code completion
- Fix an issue when jumping to macro definition from a macro
  expansion.
- Fix issue #1214. Socket file doesn't need to be resolved.
- Various other fixes, code cleanup and infrastructure work.
