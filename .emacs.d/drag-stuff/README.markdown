# Drag Stuff [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/rejeep/drag-stuff.el.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/rejeep/drag-stuff.el)
Drag Stuff is a minor mode for Emacs that makes it possible to drag
stuff (words, region, lines) around in Emacs.

## Installation
I recommend installing via ELPA, but manual installation is simple as well:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/drag-stuff")
    (require 'drag-stuff)

## Usage
Start `drag-stuff-mode` using.

    (drag-stuff-mode t)
    
or

    M-x drag-stuff-mode

### Drag line
To drag a line up and down. Put the cursor on that line and press
`<M-up>` and `<M-down>`.

### Drag lines
To drag several lines up and down. Select the lines you want to drag
and press `<M-up>` and `<M-down>`.

### Drag region
A region can be dragged to the left and right. Select the region you
want to drag and press `<M-left>` and `<M-right>`.

### Drag word
To drag a word. Place the cursor on the word and press `<M-left>` and
`<M-right>`.

For more information, see comments in `drag-stuff.el`.
