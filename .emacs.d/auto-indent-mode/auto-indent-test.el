;;; Commentary: 
;; 
;; * About auto-indent-mode
;; Provides auto-indentation minor mode for Emacs.  This allows the
;; following: 
;; 
;;   - Return automatically indents the code appropriately (if enabled)
;; 
;;   - Pasting/Yanking indents the appropriately
;; 
;;   - Killing line will take off unneeded spaces (if enabled)
;; 
;;   - On visit file, indent appropriately, but DONT SAVE. (Pretend like
;;     nothing happened, if enabled)
;; 
;;   - On save, optionally unttabify, remove trailing white-spaces, and
;;     definitely indent the file (if enabled).
;; 
;;   - TextMate behavior of keys if desired (see below)
;; 
;;   - Deleting the end of a line will shrink the whitespace to just one
;;     (if desired and enabled)
;; 
;;   - Automatically indent balanced parenthetical expression, or sexp, if desired
;;     `auto-indent-current-pairs' or `auto-indent-next-pair' is set
;;     to be true (disabled by default).  This is not immediate but occurs
;;     after a bit to allow better responsiveness in emacs.
;; 
;;   - Attempts to set the indentation level (number of spaces for an
;;     indent) for a major-mode.
;; 
;; All of these options can be customized. (customize auto-indent)
;; * Installing auto-indent-mode
;; 
;; To use put this in your load path and then put the following in your emacs
;; file:
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-on-visit-file t) ;; If you want auto-indent on for files
;;   (require 'auto-indent-mode)
;; 
;; 
;; If you (almost) always want this on, add the following to ~/.emacs:
;; 
;; 
;;    (auto-indent-global-mode)
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; Excluded modes are defined in `auto-indent-disabled-modes-list'
;; 
;; If you only want this on for a single mode, you would add the following to
;; ~/.emacs
;; 
;; 
;;   (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'auto-indent-mode)
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; You could always turn on the minor mode with the command
;; `auto-indent-mode'
;; * Auto-indent and repositories
;; auto-indent-mode will now be more conservative when it determines
;; that you are in a repository.  It will only indent the local area you
;; are editing.  This can be changed to be conservative everywhere by:
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-indent-style 'conservative)
;; 
;; 
;; You can revert to the old behavior of aggressive by:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-indent-style 'aggressive)
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; * Setting the number of spaces for indenting major modes
;; While this is controlled by the major mode, as a convenience,
;; auto-indent-mode attempts to set the default number of spaces for an
;; indentation for specific major mode.  
;; 
;; This is done by:
;; 1. Making local variables of all the variables specified in
;;    `auto-indent-known-indent-level-variables' and setting them to
;;    auto-indent's `auto-indent-assign-indent-level'
;; 2. Looking to see if major mode variables
;;    `major-mode-indent-level' and `major-mode-basic-offset' variables
;;    are present.  If either of these variables are present,
;;    `auto-indent-mode' sets these variables to the default
;;    `auto-indent-assign-indent-level'.   
;; 
;; * TextMate Meta-Return behavior
;; If you would like TextMate behavior of Meta-RETURN going to the
;; end of the line and then inserting a newline, as well as
;; Meta-shift return going to the end of the line, inserting a
;; semi-colon then inserting a newline, use the following:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-key-for-end-of-line-then-newline "<M-return>")
;;   (setq auto-indent-key-for-end-of-line-insert-char-then-newline "<M-S-return>")
;;   (require 'auto-indent-mode)
;;   (auto-indent-global-mode)
;; 
;; 
;; This may or may not work on your system.  Many times emacs cannot
;; distinguish between M-RET and M-S-RET, so if you don't mind a
;; slight redefinition use:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-key-for-end-of-line-then-newline "<M-return>")
;;   (setq auto-indent-key-for-end-of-line-insert-char-then-newline "<C-M-return>")
;;   (require 'auto-indent-mode)
;;   (auto-indent-global-mode)
;; 
;; 
;; If you want to insert something other than a semi-colon (like a
;; colon) in a specific mode, say colon-mode, do the following:
;; 
;; 
;;   (add-hook 'colon-mode-hook (lambda () (setq auto-indent-eol-char ":")))
;; 
;; * Notes about autopair-mode and yasnippet compatibility
;; If you wish to use this with autopairs and yasnippet, please load
;; this library first.
;; * Using specific functions from auto-indent-mode
;; 
;; Also if you wish to just use specific functions from this library
;; that is possible as well.
;; 
;; To have the auto-indentation delete characters use:
;; 
;; 
;;   
;;   (autoload 'auto-indent-delete-char "auto-indent-mode" "" t)
;;   (define-key global-map [remap delete-char] 'auto-indent-delete-char)
;;   
;;   (autoload 'auto-indent-kill-line "auto-indent-mode" "" t)
;;   (define-key global-map [remap kill-line] 'auto-indent-kill-line)
;;   
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; However, this does not honor the excluded modes in
;; `auto-indent-disabled-modes-list'
;; 
;; 
;; * Making certain modes perform tasks on paste/yank.
;; Sometimes, like in R, it is convenient to paste c:\ and change it to
;; c:/.  This can be accomplished by modifying the
;; `auto-indent-after-yank-hook'.
;; 
;; The code for changing the paths is as follows:
;; 
;; 
;;   (defun kicker-ess-fix-path (beg end)
;;     "Fixes ess path"
;;     (save-restriction
;;       (save-excursion
;;         (narrow-to-region beg end)
;;         (goto-char (point-min))
;;         (when (looking-at "[A-Z]:\\\\")
;;           (while (search-forward "\\" nil t)
;;             (replace-match "/"))))))
;;   
;;   (defun kicker-ess-turn-on-fix-path ()
;;     (interactive)
;;     (when (string= "S" ess-language)
;;       (add-hook 'auto-indent-after-yank-hook 'kicker-ess-fix-path t t)))
;;   (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'kicker-ess-turn-on-fix-path)
;; 
;; 
;; Another R-hack is to take of the ">" and "+" of a command line
;; copy. For example copying:
;; 
;;  > 
;;  > availDists <- c(Normal="rnorm", Exponential="rexp")
;;  > availKernels <- c("gaussian", "epanechnikov", "rectangular",
;;  + "triangular", "biweight", "cosine", "optcosine")
;; 
;; 
;; Should give the following code on paste:
;; 
;;  
;;  availDists <- c(Normal="rnorm", Exponential="rexp")
;;  availKernels <- c("gaussian", "epanechnikov", "rectangular",
;;  "triangular", "biweight", "cosine", "optcosine")
;; 
;; 
;; This is setup by the following code snippet:
;; 
;; 
;;   (defun kicker-ess-fix-code (beg end)
;;     "Fixes ess path"
;;     (save-restriction
;;       (save-excursion
;;         (save-match-data
;;           (narrow-to-region beg end)
;;           (goto-char (point-min))
;;           (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*[>][ \t]+" nil t)
;;             (replace-match "")
;;             (goto-char (point-at-eol))
;;             (while (looking-at "[ \t\n]*[+][ \t]+")
;;               (replace-match "\n")
;;               (goto-char (point-at-eol))))))))
;;   
;;   (defun kicker-ess-turn-on-fix-code ()
;;     (interactive)
;;     (when (string= "S" ess-language)
;;       (add-hook 'auto-indent-after-yank-hook 'kicker-ess-fix-code t t)))
;;   (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'kicker-ess-turn-on-fix-code)
;; 
;; 
;; * Auto-indent and org-mode
;; Auto-indent does not technically turn on for org-mode.  Instead the
;; following can be added/changed:
;; 
;; 1. `org-indent-mode' is turned on when `auto-indent-start-org-indent' 
;;    is true.
;; 2. The return behavior is changed to newline and indent in code blocks
;;    when `auto-indent-fix-org-return' is true.
;; 3. The backspace behavior is changed to auto-indent's backspace when
;;    `auto-indent-delete-backward-char' is true.  This only works in
;;    code blocks. 
;; 4. The home beginning of line behavior is changed to auto-indent's
;;    when `auto-indent-fix-org-move-beginning-of-line' is true.
;; 5. The yank/paste behavior is changed to auto-indent in a code block
;;    when `auto-indent-fix-org-yank' is true.
;; 6. The auto-filling activity in source-code blocks can break your code
;;    depending on the language.  When `auto-indent-fix-org-auto-fill' is
;;    true, auto-filling is turned off in`org-mode' source blocks.
;; * FAQ
;; ** Why isn't my mode indenting?
;; Some modes are excluded for compatability reasons, such as
;; text-modes.  This is controlled by the variable
;; `auto-indent-disabled-modes-list'
;; ** Why isn't my specific mode have the right number of spaces?
;; Actually, the number of spaces for indentation is controlled by the
;; major mode. If there is a major-mode specific variable that controls
;; this offset, you can add this variable to
;; `auto-indent-known-indent-level-variables' to change the indentation
;; for this mode when auto-indent-mode starts.
;; 
;; See:
;; 
;; - [[http://www.pement.org/emacs_tabs.htm][Understanding GNU Emacs and tabs]]
;; - [[http://kb.iu.edu/data/abde.html][In Emacs how can I change tab sizes?]]
;; *** How do I add a variable to the auto-indent tab offset?
;; You can add the variable by using =M-x customize-group
;; auto-indent-mode= and then add the variable to
;; `auto-indent-known-indent-levels'.  Another way is to use lisp:
;; 
;; 
;;   (add-to-list 'auto-indent-known-indent-levels 'c-basic-offset)
;; 
;; 
;; *** How do I change the auto-indent default offset?
;; You can change auto-indent's default offset by:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-assign-indent-level 4) ; Changes the indent level to
;;                                           ; 4 spaces instead of 2.
;; 
;; 
;; *** How do I turn of auto-indent assignment?
;; When auto-indent finds a tab-size variable, it assigns the indentation
;; level to the globally defined `auto-indent-assign-indent-level'.  If
;; you do not want this to happen you can turn it off by
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-assign-indent-level-variables nil)
;; 
;; 
;; ** Why is auto-indent-mode changing tabs to spaces
;; I prefer tabs instead of spaces.  You may prefer the other way.  The
;; options to change this are:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-mode-untabify-on-yank-or-paste nil)
;; 
;; 
;; to keep tabs upon paste.
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-untabify-on-visit-file nil) ; Already disabled
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; To keep tabs upon visiting a file.
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-untabify-on-save-file nil)
;; 
;; 
;; to turn off changing tabs to spaces on file save.
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-backward-delete-char-behavior nil) ; Just delete one character.
;; 
;; 
;; So that backspace doesn't change tabs to spaces.
;; 
;; If you wish to be more extreme you can also change spaces to tabs by:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-mode-untabify-on-yank-or-paste 'tabify)
;; 
;; 
;; to keep tabs upon paste.
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-untabify-on-visit-file 'tabify) ; I would suggest
;;                                           ; leaving this off.
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; To keep tabs upon visiting a file.
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-untabify-on-save-file 'tabify)
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; ** Argh -- Auto-indent is messing with my indentation.  What can I do?
;; If you do not like the default indentation style of a particular
;; mode, sometimes you may adjust the indetation by hand.  Then you
;; press the return button and all your hard work is erased.  This can
;; be quite frustrating.  
;; 
;; What is happening, is that auto-indent is fixing the current line's
;; indentation and then indenting the next line on pressing enter.  This
;; can be turned off customizing the `auto-indent-newline-function' to
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-newline-function 'newline-and-indent) 
;; 
;; 
;; This will insert a newline and then indent.  Not reindent according
;; to the major mode's conventions.
