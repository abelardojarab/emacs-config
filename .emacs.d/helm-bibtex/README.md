helm-bibtex
===========

A helm source for managing BibTeX bibliographies.

## Key features:

- Quick access to your bibliography from within Emacs
- Provides instant search results as you type
- Quick access to online bibliographic databases such as Pubmed,
  arXiv, Google Scholar, Library of Congress, etc.
- Support for multiple BibTeX files
- Open the PDF associated with an entry
- Open the URL or DOI of an entry in the browser
- Insert LaTeX cite command, ebib link, or pandoc citation depending on document type
- Insert BibTeX entry or plain text reference
- Add PDFs as attachments to emails
- Add notes to an entry
- Edit selected entry

Here is a screenshot showing a search for entries with the word "eye tracking".

The regular expression "eye.?tracking" allows searching for different spellings ("eye tracking", "eye-tracking", "eyetracking").  A looped square symbol (⌘) next to an entry indicates that a PDF is available.  A pen symbol (✎) means that notes were added.  At the bottom, there are dummy entries that can be used to search online databases.  This list can be extended using the customization variable `helm-bibtex-fallback-options`.

## Requirements

In order to run helm-bibtex, a number of packages have to be installed on your system.  The easiest way to get these packages is through [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/).

- [Helm](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/helm): incremental search framework (helm-bibtex is a plug-in for Helm)
- [parsebib](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/parsebib): a parser for BibTeX files 
- [dash](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/dash): a powerful list-processing library
- [s](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/s): the long lost Emacs string manipulation library.
- [f](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/f): a modern API for working with files and directories

## Installation

Helm-bibtex can be installed via [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/helm-bibtex).  Alternatively, put the file `helm-bibtex.el` in a directory included in your load-path.  Add the following line to your start-up file (typically init.el):

    (autoload 'helm-bibtex "helm-bibtex" "" t)

Tell helm-bibtex where your BibTeX file is by setting the customization variable `helm-bibtex-bibliography`.

    (setq helm-bibtex-bibliography "/path/to/bibtex-file.bib")

Alternatively, you can specify a list of BibTeX files.

    (setq helm-bibtex-bibliography '("/path/to/bibtex-file-1.bib" "/path/to/bibtex-file-2.bib"))

Other customization variables are:

- `helm-bibtex-library-path`: Location where PDFs of the entries are stored
- `helm-bibtex-pdf-symbol`: The symbol used to indicate that a PDF is present.  This should be one character (default: "⌘")
- `helm-bibtex-format-insert-citation-functions`: The functions used for formatting citations.  The publication can be cited, for example, as `\cite{key}` or `ebib:key` depending on the major mode of the current buffer.  Note that the functions should accept a list of keys as input.  With multiple marked entries one can insert multiple keys at once, e.g. `\cite{key1,key2}`.  See the functions `helm-bibtex-format-citation-ebib` and `helm-bibtex-format-citation-cite` as examples.  People who don't use Ebib (like myself) might prefer to use `helm-bibtex-format-citation-org-link-to-PDF` in org mode files, which inserts an org link to the PDF.
- `helm-bibtex-notes-path`: Location where notes are stored (one file per entry)
- `helm-bibtex-notes-extension`: File extension of the files containing the notes
- `helm-bibtex-notes-symbol`: The symbol used to indicate that notes were added.  This should be one character (default: "✎").
- `helm-bibtex-fallback-options`: Online databases for which dummy entries are provided
- `helm-bibtex-browser-function`: The browser that is used to access online databases
- `helm-bibtex-additional-search-fields`: Fields that are used for searching in addition to the default fields (author, title, year, entry-key, entry-type).  Can be used, for instance, to include keywords in searches: `(setq helm-bibtex-additional-search-fields '(keywords))`
- `helm-bibtex-pdf-open-function`: Function used for opening PDFs (the default function opens them in Emacs).

Helm-bibtex assumes that PDFs and notes have the BibTeX key of their associated entries as their base names plus ".pdf" for PDFs and whatever extension is configured for notes (".org" by default).

By default, helm-bibtex opens PDFs in Emacs.  If you prefer to use an external viewer (e.g. evince), you can put the following in your initialization file:

    (setq helm-bibtex-pdf-open-function
      (lambda (fpath)
        (start-process "evince" "*evince*" "evince" fpath)))

On OSX, you can use the following to open the PDF with the system-wide default viewer

    (setq helm-bibtex-pdf-open-function
      (lambda (fpath)
        (start-process "open" "*open*" "open" fpath)))

or the following to open PDFs with Skim:

    (setq helm-bibtex-pdf-open-function
      (lambda (fpath)
        (start-process "skim" "*skim*" "open" (concat "-a /Applications/Skim.app " fpath))))

## Usage

The command `helm-bibtex` starts a new search.  It is recommended to bind it to a convenient key for quick access.  For filtering, the following fields are used: author, title, year, and entry-type.  Regular expressions can be used as search terms.  Example searches:

Everything ever published by Janet Fodor:

    phdthesis

A common use case is where a search term is written in a document (say in your LaTeX manuscript) and you want to search for it in your bibliography.  In this situation, just start helm-bibtex and hit `M-n`.  This inserts the word under the cursor as the search term.  (This is a helm feature and can be used in all helm sources not just helm-bibtex.)  Note that it is also possible to use BibTeX keys for searching.  So if your cursor is on a BibTeX key (e.g., in a LaTeX cite command) you can start helm-bibtex, hit `M+n` and see the entry associated with that BibTeX key.

There are several actions for matching BibTeX entries:

- Open the PDF file associated with an entry if available (default).
- Open the URL or DOI associated with an entry in your web browser.
- Insert citation at point.
- Insert reference at point.
- Insert BibTeX key at point.
- Insert BibTeX entry at point.
- Add PDF as attachment to email.
- Edit notes associated with an entry.
- Show the entry in BibTeX file.

To execute an action, select an entry and press `TAB` to see the list of available actions.  The default action (open PDF) can be triggered by just pressing enter in the list of matching entries.
