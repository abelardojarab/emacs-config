Flycheck is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension for GNU Emacs 24,
intended as replacement for the older Flymake extension which is part of GNU
Emacs.

It uses various syntax checking and linting tools to check the contents of
buffers, and reports warnings and errors directly in the buffer, or in an
optional error list.  The following screenshot shows Flycheck in an Emacs Lisp
buffer, with error highlights, indicators and the error list:

The color theme in the screenshot is `Solarized Light`_, together with the the
`Source Code Pro`_ font.
