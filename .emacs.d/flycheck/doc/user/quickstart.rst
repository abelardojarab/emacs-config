 Quickstart
============

This page gives a quick introduction into Flycheck and an overview of its most
important features.  Before you start here please make sure that Flycheck is
:ref:`installed <flycheck-installation>`.

Enable Flycheck
===============

Now add the following code to your :term:`init file` to permanently enable
syntax checking with Flycheck:

.. code-block:: elisp

   (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)

Install syntax checker programs
===============================

Now you need to install syntax checking programs for the languages you'd like to
use Flycheck with.  The :ref:`list of supported languages <flycheck-languages>`
tells you which languages Flycheck supports and what programs it uses.

For instance, you can install Pylint_ for Python and ESLint_ for Javascript:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ pip install pylint
   $ npm install eslint

.. _Pylint: https://pylint.org
.. _ESLint: http://eslint.org

Check syntax in a buffer
========================

Now you are ready to use Flycheck in a Python or Javascript buffer.  Visit a
Python or Javascript file and check whether your Flycheck setup is complete with
`C-c ! v`.

If everything is green Flycheck will now start to check the buffer on the fly
while you are editing.  Whenever you make a mistake that the eslint or Pylint
catch Flycheck will highlight the corresponding place in the buffer with an
error underline whose color reflects the severity of the issue.  Additionally
Flycheck will put a symbol into the fringe for affected lines and show the total
number of errors and warnings in the buffer in the mode line.

Navigate and list errors
========================

With `C-c ! n` and `C-c ! p` you can now jump back and forth between erroneous
places.  If you keep on such a place for a little while Flycheck will show the
corresponding error message in the each area.  Likewise, if you hover such a
place with the mouse cursor Flycheck will show the error message in a tooltip.

Press `C-c ! l` to pop up a list of all errors in the current buffer.  This list
automatically updates itself when you fix errors or introduce new ones, and
follows the currently selected buffer.  If the error list is selected you can
type :kbd:`n` and :kbd:`p` to move up and down between errors and jump to their
corresponding location in the buffer.
